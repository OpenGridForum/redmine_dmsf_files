2. Introduction:
----------------
  
  2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.  Background
      to the project is another alternative. (E.g. 100 words).

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code that models an ensemble
of particles in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state. It can model
atomic, polymeric, biological, metallic, or granular systems using a
variety of force fields and boundary conditions.

LAMMPS runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop machines,
 but is designed for parallel computers. It will run on any parallel machine 
that compiles C++ and supports the MPI message-passing library. This includes 
distributed- or shared-memory parallel machines and Beowulf-style clusters.

LAMMPS can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or billions.
The current version of LAMMPS is written in C++. 
In the most general sense, LAMMPS integrates Newton's
 equations of motion for collections of atoms, molecules,
or macroscopic particles that interact via short- or long-range forces 
with a variety of initial and/or boundary conditions. For computational 
efficiency LAMMPS uses neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles. 
The lists are optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive at
 short distances, so that the local density of particles never becomes too 
large. On parallel machines, LAMMPS uses spatial-decomposition techniques to 
partition the simulation domain into small 3d sub-domains, one of which is
 assigned to each processor. Processors communicate and store "ghost"
 atom information for atoms that border their sub-domain. LAMMPS is most
 efficient (in a parallel sense) for systems whose particles fill a 3d rectangular 
box with roughly uniform density.

3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
----------------------------------------------------------  
  
  Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.  E.g. "move
  a file from A to B," "start a job."
  
  Please include figures if possible.

  If your use case requires multiple components of functionality, please  
  provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet points of 50
  words per functionality are acceptable.
  
  ...
Customer needs to create a trajectory starting from an input configuration
and an input script, and to have access later to the created trajectory for analysis.
the trajectory may represent an important amount of data and should pre An output configuration ferably
be kept on the server that was used for the calculation. An output configuration 
and runtime flow traces should be returned to the user.

  
4. Customers:
-------------

      administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying 
      the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  

number of processors is selected by users
memory needs are determined by the application but can be estimated by the
user.
  ...
  
  
  7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
      by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
      of information, size of datasets?

CPU power is the most important criterion
