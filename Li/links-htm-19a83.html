As part of scoping the group, we have also been trying to work out which
groups we are going to have a relationship with.  The idea is that we
nominate someone who is active in both GRAAP and the related group who
can act as a link.  We already have people nominated to be our links to
the following groups:
<ul>
<li><A href="http://www.ggf.org/ogsa-wg">Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA-WG)</A>
<li><A href="http://www-itg.lbl.gov/GPA">Grid Protocol Architecture (GPA-RG)</A>
<li><A href="http://www.ggf.org/2_SEC/NoFrames/GSI.htm">Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI-WG)</A>
<li><A href="http://www.isi.edu/~flon/cgs-wg/index.htm">CIM based Grid Schema (CGS-WG)</A>
<li><A href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/RD/coop/ggf/sd-wg.html">Scheduling Dictionary (SD-WG)</A>
</ul>
We are also looking for contacts in the following groups:
<ul>
<li><A href="http://www.drmaa.org/">Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA-WG)</A>
<li><A href="http://www.pulsipher.org/npia/">New Productivity Initiative (NPI-WG)</A>
</ul>
To volunteer to be our link to one of these groups, you can <A HREF="mailto:v.sander@fz-juelich.de">send us an e-mail</A>.  If there are other groups you
feel we should be linking to, then you can post something on the mailing
list.
