From F2F 2003/07/29-31

* F2F wrap up

  # Next F2F will be held Sep 3-4 (Wed, Thu)
  # **Morning to Evening** (rather than noon to noon).
  # Decided by majority voting.

  - For next F2F
    - Platform Document
      - Work on Sec.5 assignments 
      - Check for holes in first teleconf after this F2F
        - (Fred, Andreas) Where to put CMM, and other (don't say
          "infrastructure") stuff is still not addressed.
      - Review first draft 2 weeks after this F2F on teleconf
      - Produce reasonably stable draft of Sec.5 by the teleconf
        before the next F2F.

    - Use cases
      <jeffrin's plan>

  - For GGF9
    - Plan to have solid draft of Platform to show people.
    - Identify 1-2 people from potentially related wg and arrange a
      discussion with them.
      - Plan to talk to something like 10 groups, so 3 sessions may
        have to be dedicated to this.
      - If no WG exists we have to decide next step, e.g., BoF?
    - Aim: Come to an agreement on their relation with OGSA and
      'their' portion of the Platform document.

    # Agreed to chop up each OGSA session in 2,3 segments (e.g., 30
    # min each) and have a chat with specific groups during that
    # time. Groups to be decided later.

  - Initially focus on relations with groups in GGF.
    - We also have to address other groups, e.g., OASIS, DMTF.
