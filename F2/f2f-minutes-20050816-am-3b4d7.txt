* ByteIO Use Cases

  Presentation:
  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/ByteIO_UseCases/en/1

  Neil presents slides on ByteIO use cases for files
  Neil presents slides on DAIS use cases
  - Question Jay:
       o Typical use case: most resources are flat files
       o Many people now put their stuff into databases
       o However, the applications are still designed for flat files
       o And mostly CSV files are still needed
  - Answer Mark:
       o You would write a "filter ByteIO"

  Neil continues to present the DAIS use cases
  - ByteIO provides access to the data. It is not intended as a proxy
    to streamable data.

   Neil presents the Visualisation Service use case
  - Fred asks:
       o Are you aware of performance?
  - Mark answers:
       o ByteIO requires a base set of data transfers, that every
         ByteIO implementor MUST support. It allows a choice of
         protocol. At a minimum base64 encoding is required.
  - Mike Behrens asks:
       o Are or will these slides be on the GGF forge?
       o Security?
  - Mark answers:
       o Yes, they will be uploaded
       o Security is important
       o If possible, use every security means available by OGSA for
         the control channel
       o Security for the data channel is up to the implementation

* ByteIO Interfaces Overview

  Presentation:
  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/ByteIO_Overview/en/1

  Mark presents details about the technical issues of ByteIO
  - IRandomAccess
       o Each operation is atomic
           - No locking between operations. It can be implemented
             separately if needed.
       o Allows for strided reads or writes
       o What happens to the 'holes' in write session in a file:
           - The spec states it is undefined. But this is not a good
             choice.
             - Discussed alternatives and settled for:
             - The original content if the file exists
             - Zero/Undefined/implementation dependent if writing past
               the end of the file. The expectation would be that a
               separate operation would then 'fill in' these parts.
       o truncAppend: to capture the typical case of truncating
         to add data to a file
  - IStreamableByteIO
       o seekOrigin URI: it is an enum of 3 values.

   Questions are taken
  - Fred asks: Is there a means to get the attributes of a file?
  - Mark answers:
        o Yes, the document specifies means on how to access file
           attributes
        o The rendering document specifies the means on how this
          information is transferred (in fact, as ResourceProperties)
  - Andreas asks: GridFTP will be just one of the mechanisms?
  - Mark answers: yes
  - Mike asks:
        o Is ByteIO expected to be a lower level service than many
          other things we do?
  - Mark answers:
        o ByteIO a means to provide a simplistic access pattern to
          possibly complex access patterns
        o It also may be a foundation for an envisaged Grid File
          System
  - Mike asks: Caching on the client side?
  - Mark answers:
        o Caching is a hot topic in OGSA
        o Generally caching is a client side issue, not directly
          related to ByteIO
  - Michel asks: Who chooses the protocol to be used for a transfer?
  - Mark answers:
         o In the current spec the server advertises the transfer
           protocols it supports and the client chooses.
   - Michel: It would also be useful to allow the other scenario of
     the client offering a choice and the server choosing. There are
     cases where this is useful.

  ACTION: Michel and Mark to discuss client vs server transfer
          protocol choice and whether there are any changes needed in 
         the ByteIO specification.  [Closed: to update spec)]

* Overview of specifications

    Refer to ByteIO gridforge site:
      https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/byteio-wg

  Mark shows highlights of the ByteIO documents
  - There are two documents:
    - First document describes the semantics and features required for
      a rendering.
    - Second document defines the rendering for the OGSA WSRF BP 1.0
  - File creation is left out of scope right now.
  - Andreas asks: Relation to RNS?
  - Mark answers:
        o No direct relation to RNS, except for CIFS and NFS use case,
          where the file system structure becomes important. The
          ByteIO and RNS specs could be combined to provide part of
          this functionality.
