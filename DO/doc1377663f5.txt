                  to Andreas Savva who will merge them with his minutes.
                  AI-0831a: Andreas Savva to send out merged minutes.

- AI-0828c: Closed.
            Hiro asked Greg Newby abut the doc status but got no answer.
            Instead, Joel Replogle stated the docs are in the pipeline, and 
            will be published before GGF18
- AI-0817a: Postponed until GGF18
- AI-0817b: Closed.
            First draft sent to OGSA ML.
- AI-0810a: Ongoing. 
            Several updates sent to the relevant lists and waiting for 
            updates. Finished scenario version pendding.
- AI-0803e: Ongoing
            No progress.
- AI-0803f: Ongoing
            No progress.
- AI July F2F Ravi: Ongoing.

** OGSA F2F meeting agenda update **

- Joint EMS/Data session, and HPCP session on Thursday
- RSS session will be moved to Thursday
- Formal Group Diner at Mikes house on Thu evening (~ 10 people 
  attending), result from the Zoomerang survey
- Additional Group Diner propably likely on Friday night - coordination 
  with Jay needed


** EMS scenarios **

- AI-0831b: Hiro to send CDDLM & CDL working copies to Andreas as they 
            are slightly different from the versions in this draft
- Andreas walks the attendees through the EMS Architecture Scenarios 
  document, draft 10
- section 4.1: This scenario is (currently?) not normative. 
               Donal's comment on the list is that "the JS updates the 
               IS" is incorrect.
               Andreas agrees, but is not sure which entity should update 
               the registry.
- AI-0831c: Andreas to update secction 4.1 of the EMS Architecture scenarios
- section 4.2: 
    - Application version is not mentioned in this section and needs to 
      be added.
- AI-0831d: Anderas to add the Application Version in section 4.2 of the EMS 
            Arch Scenarios
- AI-0831e: Andreas to talk to ACS working group for refining this scenario.
- The group discusses Donal's comment on the mailing list (31 Aug, 14:20) 
  whether the JM has to rewrite the JSDL document after deployment, but before
  submission
    - Donal and Andreas agree to talk offline on this issue
- The group discusses A Grimshaw's question why there is a requirement that the
  JSDL document needs be rewritten by the JM
    - Andrew Grimshaw: The various services involved in EMS should -
      if needed - rewrite the submitted JSDDL document in order to get
      it closer and closer to the actual execution. It should be the
      responsibility of the service to rewrite according to the
      service it offers, and not by another entity that then ought to
      understnad what that service did
    - A Grimshaw proposes to introduce RNS names to EMS, particularly 
      section 4.2
    - There is still controvercy on this issue, and more advanced scenarios 
      will attempt to solve this issue.
- AI-0831f: Andreas to look up RNS and probably update the EMS Arch 
            Scenarios document
- Next review isof the document is at GGF18, EMS session


** Joint EMS & Data scenarios **

- Dave Berry sent a Parameter Scan scneario to the OGSA ML (30 Aug 19:37)
- Dave walks the group through the scenario diagram
- Donal: Through JSDL one can explicitly request the data being deleted 
  ("jsdl:DeleteOnTermonation" element)
- Mark Morgan suggests an alternative view on this:
    - Reuse specs that are already or almost already out there
    - This modifies the data transfer service sub-set (using RNS and "copy")
    - Suggests to use existing specs as much as possible
    - Dave Berry: The Transfer Service mentioned in the diagram may be a 
      ByteIO service or OGSA-DMI or else.
- The scenario is agreed upon in the group
- The transformation of thee scenarios into concrete implementations leaves 
  room for implementers to use certain specifications
- Hiro: The asymmetry between input data and output data in relation to the 
        BES container is irritating
    - Dave Berry: This is actually an artifact of the scenario editing and not 
                  intended to show real asymmetry
- AI-0831g: Dave Berry to revise the joint Data/EMS scenario and add sequence
            diagrams including implementation variations, i.e. ByteIO, by GGF18
- "Result data" and "Output data" are synonymous, as are "Input data" and 
  "boundary condition data".
- AI-0831h: Mark Morgan and Andrew Grimshaw: provide an outline sequence how 
            BES, ByteIO, RNS, etc. are combined together at University of 
            Virginia
