Actions
-------

[MAA] To come up with a test plan for WS-DAIR.

Outstanding actions from previous call:

[MAA] speak to the ByteIO folks to determine whether they had a
       rationale for using document/literal and establish whether
       there is a preference in OGF in general.

       Have had a discussion on the dais & ByteIO mailing lists.
       No definite rationale for doing this but it was pointed out
       that WSRF Application notes expresses a preference for
       document/literal, see:

       http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/dais-wg/2009-April/000277.html

[MJJ] check whether changing the OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR implementation to
       use document/literal would entail a lot of work.

       Done.
       http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/dais-wg/2009-April/000280.html

[MJJ] Put a version of the DAIX test-suite on the DAIS Grid Forge.

       Done. See:

- Agenda bashing

No new items to add to the agenda.

- Process
- Agree on:
  * binding document/literal or rpc/literal

Document/literal is to be used for the interop testing.  There was no
clear rationale from the ByteIO group about why they used
document/literal - other than this is the preferred method for
WSRF. The fact that ByteIO went in this direction establishes a
precedent. Miguel gave a possible rationale for a preference for
document/literal.

Need to put all of these items together to provide a rationale
for DAIS.

- Come up with a scenario and database to use

Client---> Service ---> database

The underlying database can be "works" used by AMGA or
"littleblackbook" used by OGSA-DAI.

Mike commented that it would be nice to have some stored procedures to
get multiple result sets back from the database to test this
functionality.

- Putting up end points to test

Both AMGA and OGSA-DAI have put up end points.
Details up on the Wiki:

- Coming up with a test suite

Sunil has almost finished preparing a test suite. 
Sunil will upload this to the wiki once finished. 

It tests the WS-DAIR interface only - it includes
a very simple set of 40 or 50 requests and sends these to a 
service and checks that the answer conform to the spec.

Sunil has written a simple document that explains it. 
It uses SOAPUI tool (http://www.soapui.org/). 

Mike emphasised the fact that we should still come up with a test
plan. Sunil's test suite is based on the DAIX test suite produced by
Steven Lynden. Mario will come up with an initial test plan for WS-DAIR.

- Roles

Steve Lynden can try to to do some interop testing if he has time.
Giacinto has been keen to do some work on this but was not on the
call.  AMGA team should test the OGSA-DAI Service and OGSA-DAI folks
should probably test the AMGA service too.  Mandatory features have
to be implemented by the two implementations while optional features
should be implemented by one.  When we have test plan we can go ahead
- hope to have something ready by the next call and we can then start
doing interop.

- Time lines

Call on Wed 13 May at 8:30 UK time (GMT+1), 16:30 Japan/Korea time.

AOB

Mike run some queries against the AMGA - data resource name is not 
a URI. Mike has put details up on the wiki. See:
