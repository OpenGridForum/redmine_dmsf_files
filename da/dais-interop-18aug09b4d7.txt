Agenda
------

        - Agenda bashing
        - Sunil report back on use of the test suites Mike produced
        - Outstanding issues in the interop document
        - Planning

---

Walked through version 25 of the interop document available from:

http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc15667?nav=1

accepted the changes and addressed outstanding comments.

Inconsistent use of soapUI and SoapUI - Mike to fix.

Sunil run the test suites provided by Mike.  The results are
summarised in tables included in the document.

Sunil will propose a new slightly relaxed success condition for Test 2
that can accommodate both AMGA and OGSA-DAI else two variants may be
required. Sunil will email the mailing list with the new proposal

After some discussion it was decided that we can roll back to Sunil's
original version for tests 6, 11 and 17 - Mike's modifications no 
longer necessary. Sunil to make changes to the test suites to reflect
this.

Sunil still to use the test suite that has the qualified names in it.

Any changes that are required to the DAIX specification should be 
noted in a tracker to be taken into account when any interop for
the DAIX spec takes place.

These test suites will become the canonical versions - should probably
be given a 1.0 version with an AMGA and OGSA-DAI flavour. Also, have
instructions on how to modify these for a third implementation.

Very close to a final document now - hopefully only 1 or 2 telcons
to go.

Date of Next Call 8:30am UK time (GMT+1) 4th September 2009.
