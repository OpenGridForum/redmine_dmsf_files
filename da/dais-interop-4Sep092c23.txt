Agenda
------

 - Review of the interop document
 - Planning

---

Sunil used the new test suites - modified the last one to make it
easier to configure by a third parties (only have to change a
configuration file). It also validates schema with elements set to
qualified by default.  Have thus done tests with qualified names.
Have tested on AMGA and OGSA-DAI. Have put the results in the
document. Nothing unexpected showed up.

This will become the canonical test suite for any future
implementations.

Need to add a summary and conclusion for the test section. Steve will
have a go at writing this.

Steve brought up the fact that factories return a data resource type
which it extends from ws-addressing - it would be better to just
return a ws-addressing which would help with tooling. Two groups have
already run into problems because of this. Nobody objected to this
proposal so it will be added as an issue with a resolution for the
core spec by Steve.

Steve will make his changes and then notify Mario who will have a
final read through the whole document - try to address any issues via
the mailing list so that our next telcon is our final telcon before
submitting the document to the OGF Editor.

Next Telcon September 15th 2009 8:30 am UK time (GMT+1).
