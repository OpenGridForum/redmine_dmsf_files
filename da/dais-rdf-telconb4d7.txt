    - ontology document
- Planning


---


Isao Kojima has been working on the motivational/glossary/scenarios
document. He will pass a copy to Steven on Monday who will have a read
through it, making any corrections, and then give back to Isao who
will then send to the mailing list/put up on Grid Forge.

Mario commented that the Glossary was probably the most important
part as that would ensure consistent terminology across both the
query and ontology specifications.

Miguel said that the Glossary had been agreed on before so there
should be no major issues there.

Mario commented that it would be good if this document could go to 
public comment before the next OGF. It would also allow work on
the query and ontology specs to be decoupled. It would be best
to wait for any feedback from the public comment phase for this 
document before submitting the other specs to see if any public
comments on the informational document impact on the specs.

The query spec is very close to going to submission. The ontology spec
has some issues still - mostly the number of operations involved even
if this is split into several profiles. This may slow or curtail
uptake. Moreover, Miguel is very busy until June so he cannot spend
any time on this. 

The best strategy for the ontology spec would be to try and get the
inner profile ready, through the OGF process and implemented - AIST
have committed to doing an implementation of the inner profile - and
once this is done then socialise it to see if more people can get
involved. Can also then start working on the next of the two remaining
profiles. In essence proceed incrementally.

It was discussed that it would be good if Miguel could get a very
rough first draft of the inner profile that others could work on while
he completed his thesis. He could then resume work on this in June but
things would, hopefully, have moved forward in the meantime.

Thus by the end of next week hope to have:-

o A first complete draft of the motivation/scenarios/glossary document.
o A first draft of the inner profile for the ontology spec.

OGF26 DAIS presence was discussed. It would be good to have a session
there but not clear as yet as to who will be attending the meeting.

Next call 8am UK time (GMT+1) 23 April 2009.
