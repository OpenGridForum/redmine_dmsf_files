       - Planning

---

For this call we walked through version 21 of the interop document
available at:

   http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc15667?nav=1

Mario commented that we should provide some documentation on the
SoapUI based test suite.  Steven will add some content in an appendix
about the SoapUI test suite. Sunil and Mike to expand this if necessary.

Both SQLCommunicationArea and SQLCommunicationsArea used in the spec -
need to make consistent - adopt SQLCommunicationsArea unless the other
version is more authoritative. Also affects issue 32 on p32. Steven
will have a look as to whether there is external consensus and use
that otherwise adopt SQLCommunicationsArea.

Section 6.1.2 details the changes made to the test suite.

Test-2 seems incomplete. Missing a condition for that test.
Sunil need Mike to add what bits that need to be added. Mike to
add something that Sunil can then adapt.

"?" is not a URI so that was changed in the test suite.

Sunil will check the SoapUI configuration file to see if there are any
problems for AMGA.

Test 19 Mike added a forward access mode as well as the random access
mode supported by AMGA.

Remove the "name" attribute from all GetSQLXXXPropertyDocument for
input and output elements. Steve to note down as an issue at the back
of the document.

Remove the example that has www.sqlquery.org from the spec - the
language map element (example configuration map in the
document). Steve to add to the issues at the back of the document.

Some bugs discovered in the OGSA-DAI implementation are documented.

Issue with validation that may have to do with the tooling. Should
probably be noted in the SoapUI appendix.

Should make a DatasetData element optional else a number of these with
no content will be introduced in the messages.

Had 5 failures in the initial run of the test-suite for the OGSA-DAI
DAIR implementation.

Test 11 SchemaCompliance failure - getting an SQLResponse property
document. Need to the SQLResponse schema to be added to the WSDL.
Steven to add these to the proposed changes to the spec.

Test 27 & 34 XPath Match fails - fixed by using qualified namespaces.

Test 30 run sql update and get

<xsd:element name="SQLUpdateCount" type="xsd:int"/>

which fails if you try and validate it against the schema. There is a
fix by defining it within the element itself. Not sure if it is a
limitation in axis. Mike to have another look and propose some
recommendation.

Test 16 - got schema compliance error. Only thing to fix this was to
change the wsdl/schema it goes away. Are there different wsdl/xsd or
is it a binding issue?

This could be a SoapUI limitation. When Sunil tries the modified
tests it will be using the test suite with our schema:

 - fixed test suite with the AMGA schema
 - fixed test suite with the ogsa-dai schema/wsdl
 - fixed test suite with the ogsa-dai schema/wsdl and default qualified 
   name space

Sunil can try this out and comment back. Mike will put up different
versions of the OGSA-DAI.

Second run of test all run apart from test 30.

Continued to examine the proposed resolutions added by Mario and
commented on by Mike at the back of the document.

Next stages:

   - Steven will put up an updated version of the interop document.
   - Mike will pass Sunil updated versions of the test suite and
     the location of the OGSA-DAI DAIR test services.
   - Sunil to go through the updated test suite and note any issues
     and see whether any of the few outstanding issues can be resolved.
   - All to go through the outstanding issues and resolutions in 
     section 7 of the document.

Hopefully getting very close to the end game now.

Date of Next Call 8:30am UK time (GMT+1) 18 August 2009.
