Actions
-------

[MAA] Read and comment back on the RDF(S) document

[MEG] Report back on who from UPM could do an implementation of the 
      query document and on what time lines.

[MEG] Talk to the ADMIRE developer who is using the WSDL/XSD from the
      query spec and report back if there are any issues.

[MAA] Publicise the availability of WS-DAI/WS-DAIR/WS-DAIX WSDL & XSD
      on SVN on GridForge. 

[MEG] Put the WSDL/XSD for the RDF(S) spec on svn on Grid Forge.

[SL]  Put the WSDL/XSD for the query spec on svn on Grid Forge.



Henceforth refer to the motivational/glossary/scenarios document as
the DAIS RDF Motivational Document. This is a working title and not
necessarily the final document name. Isao currently has the write
token on this. He has been very busy and will try to send this out as
soon as he can

The ontology document inner profile was sent out to the list by
Miguel.  OGSA-DAI-RDF already implements some of these operations.
Steven will pass this on to the implementors to comment.

No API changes for the moment.  Removed some operations from the
repository factory interface (these will be available in other
profiles).  Also made some changes to the introduction.

Query document requires the motivational document to be complete before
progressing, i.e. past the OGF process.  Looking for an implementation
of the Query document from UPM. Miguel will talk to Oscar and report
on who will be doing this and on what time frames.

Miguel would like feedback from the implementors of the RDF(S) spec at
AIST when this happens.

Miguel noted that a developer on the ADMIRE project was trying to use
the WSDL/XSD in the query document and had run into problems. Miguel
is going to confirm this and report back. 

Brief discussion about making WSDL/XSD available on the Grid Forge
svn repository. Mario put the WSDL/XSD for the other DAIS specs 
there but had not really publicised it. Miguel had had some issues
trying to use it. Mario to publicise with instructions on how to
get started.

No DAIS had been booked for OGF26 as no one had said they would be
attending for definite.
