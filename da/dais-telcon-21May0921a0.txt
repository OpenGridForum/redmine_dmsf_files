DAIS RDF Telcon - 21 May 2009
=============================

Present
-------

   	Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
   	Steven Lynden, AIST
   	Miguel Esteban Gutierrez, UPM

Agenda
------

- Progress, status of:
        - DAIS RDF motivational document
        - query document
        - ontology documents
- Planning

Actions
-------

[MEG] Put the WSDL/XSD for the RDF(S) spec on SVN on Grid Forge.

Completed Actions
-----------------

[SL] Get a list of the most recent changes that have been made to the
     RDF query specification by the AIST implementor. Publicise any
     changes that have been made (tracker/mailing list).

     Only one change that is not a typo - most are typos - extend end
     point reference for a factory type. Problems extending it with
     JAXB - there are some other ways of getting round this. SL will
     see if there are other ways of getting round this without changing
     the factory message type. At most it will turn out to be an issue
     if one is using JAXB.

[MEG] Get Carlos (ADMIRE developer) to join the DAIS mailing list and
      encourage him to participate in the spec process.

      Already on the mailing list. He will participate in the spec 
      process. May attend future calls.

[SL]  Create a set of subdirectories in the SVN repository for
      the RDF ontology and query wsdl/xsd.

      Done. People should have a look.

[MAA] Move the old ontology document into the old documents folder.

      Done.

----

Motivational document - it looks like Isao may have more time in the
near future to work on this document.

Query document is almost there - needs a bit of an update.

Ontology - no progress, Miguel is too busy. 

AIST has a partial implementation of an older version of the ontology
zeroth profile.

UPM are progressing with an implementation of the query spec. AIST has
addressed the issues that Carlos, the implementor, run into.

Miguel will not be able to attend the next call but he will try to see
if Carlos can make it in his place.
