[MAA] To come up with a test plan for WS-DAIR.

       Done - well documented passed to Steven.

+---

MAA passed a very rough document to Steven Lynden. Steven looking
at it at the moment and hoping to produce something for comment by
the end of the week.

Discussion about the dataSet format URI. Steven wanted to specify
one but after discussion it was decided that this should be configurable.
Any dataset format URI is ok.

OGSA-DAI have a document that states which operations have been
implemented and which have not been implemented.

No documentation for AMGA about what has been implemented and not
been implemented. Sunil will try to produce one.

GenericQuery discussion. It is currently deemed to be an optional
operation. Steven thought it was too generic to test but Mario
thought it served a purpose.

Discussion of which operations have been or not been implemented.

SQLCommunicationsArea, output parameters are just stored procedure.
GetSQLReturnValue requires stored procedures. AMGA implementation
does not use stored procedures - should make some of these operations
optional as this is likely to be a generic
requirement. SQLCommunicationsArea should be optional too. May
recommend this a s a spec change.

Agree on the database to have the same table name and column names.
Shall use littleblackbook, test database used by OGSA-DAI, for the
test schema and also have stored procedures for MySQL. Mike will send
the stored procedure information to Steven Lynden.

Sunil sent out document on the changes on the WSDL he had to make for
his implementation. Sunil would like comments back on this.

Mike will provide Sunil with comments on the interop doc and send a
document/literal client to Sunil.

Elias from EPCC found a bug in the OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR - cannot return
more than 1000 rows. This ill not affect interop but it may affect
performance evaluations. Not sure when this will be fixed.
