[MAA] To come up with a test plan for WS-DAIR.

      Started but not complete.

---

AIST had issues with the implementation of the OGSA-DAI RDF that
required changes to the WSDL in the core spec because of the way that
JAXB works.  Steven interested if other people run into other issues.
Sunil used gSOAP. He had to make a number of changes to the WSDL in
order to get it to work but not apparently the same problem that the
AIST developer experienced.

Mario encouraged folks to use the DAIS mailing list to ensure that the
process is open as opposed to using point to point communications.

Mike and Sunil have been working on the interop process and it appears
that, bar one or two issues, the two implementations seem to
inter operate. Really need the test document to give this structure.
Mario is going to have another go at progressing this document and
pass it on to Steven next week and put up on GridForge. Hope is that
something will be ready by the next telcon. Then quickly write the
experiences document based on this and complete the process for the
WS-DAI and WS-DAIR specs.

Sunil asked if there was an OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR client available that he
could use to test against his AMGA service. Mario said he would ask
Mike.
