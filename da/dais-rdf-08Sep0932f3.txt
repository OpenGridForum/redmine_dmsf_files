  - Motivational document
  - Planning

---

Miguel has read through the motivational document and will make some
changes and upload tonight.

There was a discussion about terminology. Strangeness of
the terminology "Resource Data Resource" but resource is
a term with a well defined meaning in RDF so do not want
to lose the RDF audience. Discussion was postponed.

Mario still feels uneasy about the number of operations in
the ontology part having been gone through the interop 
process of the ontology part. Steve kind of echos this.
Miguel argued that groups like SAGA have even more operations.
Mario thought that SAGA was slightly different - the concern
is over uptake and interop testing. Discussion was postponed.

Question about the status of the motivational document and whether
terminology defined should be normative. Mario argued that it was
there for consistency between the two sub specs and perhaps it was
more of a case that it SHOULD be used in this way and not MUST be used
in this way.

Diagram consistency is an issue: UML looks slightly out of place.
Again, discussion on this was postponed until the document has evolved
a little bit more.

Shall try to do a quick iteration of the document in the following
order:

Miguel -> Mario -> Oscar -> Steven (next free person).

Shall discuss the document at the next call at 8am on Friday the 25th
of September.
