DAIS Interop Telcon 15 September 2009
=====================================

Present
-------
           Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
           Steve Lynden, AIST
           Sunil Ahn, Kisti
           Mike Jackson, EPCC

Agenda
------

  - Final review of interop document

---

There was a discussion of version 31 that Mario put up
just before the call, mainly addressing the six comments
and the formatting of the document (use of courier for 
operations, properties and file names). Folks were mostly
ok about using courier font for operations.

Most of the other comments were addressed during the call
or will be addressed by Mario based on the discussion 
during the call. 

The plan is for Mario to put up another draft on-line
(hopefully today), for Mike and Sunil to make sure that
nothing was inadvertently broken, for Steve to make a 
sanity change of the document and, once this is done,
for Mario to submit the document to the OGF Editor.

Mario thanked everyone for having participated in this
exercise. There may be a need for a further telcon after
the document gets back from the OGF process otherwise 
this is indeed the final interop call.

Steven will be presenting at the next OGF about this work.  
He asked Mike and Sunil if they could provide a slide/slides 
for the OGSA-DAI and AMGA DAIR implementations respectively.
