* Glossary

  Discussion on proposed definition of provisioning and deployment

   - Comments received by email:
     - Andreas suggested stopping the first sentence at "put in use"
     - Olegario suggested more specific definitions for both
       provisioning and deployment, along the lines of "provisioning
       makes ready; deployment brings in use"
      - Confirmed again that the aim here is for a more casual
        definition. Aiming for technical correctness and
        generality. And allow other documents to make more precise
        distinctions, e.g., the OGSA EMS Scenarios, or CDDLM or ...
   - Did the definitions become longer? 
     - Merged EGA Reference Model and OGSA ones. But maybe not; since
       the deployment definition was removed.
   - Is it worth looking again at other resources (e.g., IEEE
     technical resource reference) to see how these terms are defined?
     - Not unless we think the definitions are wrong

  Jem will update the main document and upload to Gridforge.

* Ethnographic study: No comments

* Roadmap 1.1

  Chris J gave an update on current status. Work was paused for a
  while but is now getting back on track.

** Tracker Issues 

   Discussed tracker issues (concurrently updated online by Hiro)

  - artf5645: Open source projects updates: Have sent out request
    emails but did not get many responses.
     - Agreed that it is ok to update only if text is received; leave
       as is otherwise
     - Chris J has a list of projects and will put in the tracker
     - Status moved to Pending
   - artf5357: Agreed in the past that will not do anything in
     addition to what already done
     - Status moved to Closed
     - Added a a new artifact to "Update document status spreadsheet";
       assigned to Chris J
     - There were plans in the past to set up a 'semi-dynamic' method
       (with OGF) to pull data from the charters etc. This is paused.
   - artf5646: Mike has sent updated text and graph (removed WS-RT).
     - This is probably done but needs review
     - Status moved to pending
   - artf5643: Chris J to ping HPCP-WG again
   - artf5354: Status moved to Fixed

** Next Steps

   - Chris J has a number of accumulated comments from various
     sources. Will merge and respond and have a document ready for the
     F2F.
     - Chris J will send a notification email to the list when a draft
       is ready.

   - Chris J will add agenda for the F2F to the wiki.
