	AI0726a -
		Dave Snelling talked about the Unicore aspects of this.
		Agreed to close.

Workflow session proper
	Suggestion: when surveying workflow systems, keep to web services based workflows (i.e., those can be accessed
		as web services and which can consume web services).  It was observed, in an
		opposing view, that task based workflows are important to JSDL but are not part of (current) web services
		based workflows.  No resolution.
	Survey questions:
		Suggested: cosider a longer list of kinds of workflows in the general questions
		Survey 2: Need to clarify what is a standard tool.  Perhaps, what tool do you use and what standards do they support?
		Suggestion: add a question along the lines of what are the workflows being used to control?  Going along with this
			would be a question to ask who the users are.
		No one seems to know what the "User's key requirements, ket decision making" question means.  The suggestion
			jsut above will supercede this.
		Suggestion: when trying to finalize these survey questions, we should consider why we are asking these questions,
			what we hope to learn from the answers.
	What comes next after getting answers to these surveys?  What will we do with the answers?
		A concern was expressed that we will not get many answers to the survey.
		There was no resolution to the above questions.
	It was suggested that we encourage publication of exoerience documents (e.g., doing workflow using BPEL in the grid
		environment) rather than trying to create a workflow standard.
	As an alternative, it was suggested that we not do a survey but, rather, create a spreadsheet that compares the various
		workflow languages/engines we know about.  We could use the owners/users of these workflow engines to fill
		in, or valdiate, the spreadsheet.  This would be done via the OGSA mailing list.
