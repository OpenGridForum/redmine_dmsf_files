* No quorum, but decided to walk through the agenda

* Andreas suggested re-organizing wiki pages to make the generation of
  agendas for calls easier. Will talk with Hiro offline.

* AI-0409a: There is no champion for this session despite its
  perceived importance. Might be best to leave it for another OGF
  given the current lack of resources. Talk about it once more at the
  next logistics call and make a decision then

* OGF 20 session owners should update their session agendas

* When is the OGF20 OGSA dinner ?
  - Hiro will confirm the date of the chair's appreciation and other
    events before the next call 

* F2F at OGF20
