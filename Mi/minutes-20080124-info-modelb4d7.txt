OGSA Teleconf - Information Modeling Architecture - 24 January 2008
===================================================================

Participants:

- Ellen Stokes
- Andreas Savva
- Michel Drescher
- Dave Snelling
- Donal Fellows
- Sergio Andreozzi (taking notes)

1. Minutes Approval call Nov 29 and London F2F
Agreed

2. Start with use cases document
Sergio describes the example

Donal: in GLUE is it explicit the association of users to shares?
Sergio: yes, there is AccessPolicy for Endpoint and MappingPolicy for
Shares

Dave: I'm fine with the example, I would probably change share
fast/slow to blue/green
- Action: Sergio to change naming of shares
- Action: Ellen to update Sect.4 with this example

3. Discuss XML representation

Michel: what about having full XML in the appendix

Andreas: compact XML where stuff not used in floating text, while full
XML in appendix

Sergio: to provide high-level diagram showing the GLUE concepts that
are used to model the use case

4. Discuss queries

Dave: include expected outcome of queries

Andreas: ex.1 just lists the available shares, not select some share
based on some requirements

Michel: wanted to be simple in the first ex.
- in Ex.2, multiple [] can be used to have AND behavior of multiple
  requirements on sibling nodes

Dave: suggests to make AND explicit for easy of reading

Michel: differences between ex.2 and ex.3 is the usage of variable; We
can come up with a standard set of queries that can be reused
instantiating different values for

5. Discuss real production scenario and how we can add to the document

Sergio describes the use cases; it requires join.
Michel prefers not to put too complex example queries

After a discussion, we agree to:
- add the example
- Michel will add XPath snippets
- Sergio to provide XQuery

6. Discussion around next call and schedule for going public comments
Next call, 7 Feb 1 PM GMT

The plan is for the document to be submitted to the GFSG to start the
public comment process by the start of OGF22.

7. Required changes to appendix from F2F; minor issues; discuss
   offline since we already run out of time
