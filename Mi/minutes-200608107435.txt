* OGSA authorization call-out proposal review (Frank, 20 min)

Reference:
"Functional Components of Grid Service Provider Authorisation Service
Middleware"
https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc13724?nav=1

David presented a draft document, "Functional Components of Grid
Service Provider Authorisation Service Middleware", which was sent to
the OGSA-AuthZ and OGSA-WG list on Aug 9.  (The document was based on
discussions between Von, Frank and David.)

David introduced functional components, Policy Enforcement Point
(PEP), Credential Validation Service (CVS) and PDP (Policy Decision
Point) and showed four types of interactions between the components
(See Fig.1 to Fig.4 in the document).  David proposed to define two
protocols, one for CVS and the other for PDP.

The followings are the points of his proposal.
- CVS is used to validate credentials and to issue valid attributes of
  Access Requestors.
- CVS is passed authenticated name and credentials.
- CVS determines if the credential is trust worthy and returns valid
  attributes.
- An administrator manages two types of rules, auhtz decision rules and
  rules to resolve trust relationships
- CVS makes use of XACML policy query interface, but it is not
  necessarily be an XACML policy engine behind the interface.
- CVS is needed to separate authentication and authorization.

Various questions and answers arouse during the presentation and some
major points made clear in the discussion were:
  - The two protocols are intended to support all the configuration
    shown in the figures
  - Revisions of the two "OGSI" profiles are also in the scope of
    current activities of the OGSA-AuthZ-WG.
  - Defining attributes values (terms and semantics) is not in the
    scope of current activities of the OGSA-AuthZ-WG, but in its
    future scope.
The discussion were suspended until Aug 28 due to the running out of
the meeting time.

The followings are some interactions during the discussion.
* The scope of the work (1)
Q: Does the two protocols cover all the configurations shown in
   the figures?  The protocols shown in the figures look different.
A: Yes, the both protocols can cover all the configuration.  The
   current OGSA-Authz profiles can handle this kind of interactions.
Q: The current profiles are not "OGSA" profiles.  These are "OGSI"
   profiles.
A: The difference between "OGSI" and "OGSA" is small for OGSA-Authz
   profiles.  Revisions of these two profiles are also on the table.

* How to define service I/F of applications
Q: As an application desginer, do I need to choose appropriate one?
  * long interactions were taken place which Takuya couldn't perfectly
    follow, but if Takuya understood well, the answer from the authz
    wg is: *
A: Interafces of applications will not be affected.  It is the
   middleware which speaks the protocols.  Authorization is taken
   place behind the infrastructure.

* The scope of the work (2)
Q: The architecture for authorization has not clearly been defined.
   What the OGSA-AuthZ-WG are going to define?  Do we need to define
   all the comopnents?  Various terms and semantics also needs to
   be defined for attributes and policies.  These also should be
   standardized.
A: The OGSA-AuthZ-WG did the similar things in the past,
   the credential formats and terms over the SAML Attribute Assertion
   and the X.509 Attribute Certs.
Q: It covers a different interop level - only attribute name or type
   level - not the values.
A: The OGSA-AuthZ-WG focuses only on the interface level.
   David doesn't have a need to define values. (at this moment?)
   The WG needs to define them later in the future. 

* Security Profile (Core, Secure Channel) Public Comment Review

** Core profile review 

   - l.340: Added text to restrict to single key
     - Why must more than one keys be ignored? Why disallow raising a
       fault?
       - No specific reason, so agreed to soften the text to allow
         implementations to throw a fault.

   - l.167: R0301: defines that the keyinfo must be added
   - Agreed to move the previous restriction (l.340) from the appendix
     here, as a restriction in the main body of the profile.

** Secure Channel profile

   - l.70: Public comment was whether this profile "must this be used
     by all services?"
     - Revised text is still not clear enough.
     - Takuya will re-revise to clearly state that this profile is not
       mandated.
     - Andreas volunteered to review the text before call.
   - l.130: Usage of special terms
     - l.190: added citations as well
     - It is a good idea to use defined words in other places, e.g.,
       l.158, in the same manner as the OGSA WSRF BP.
     - Takuya to make sure these terms are used consistently.
   - l.214 (Sec.3.4): Addition of cryptographic algorithms
     - Original action was to list the recommended ciphers because the
       Security BP allows arbitrary ciphersuites. Takuya has put
       together a list but has not included it yet.
       - There are ~30 ciphersuites that are not recommended
     - Takuya will send out proposal and will add list to the
       document.

** Next steps 

   Takuya will update the documents per the review.

   Next security call is August 28, but might be moved depending on
   how the discussion on the list goes.

* EMS Scenarios

  Reviewed document restructuring---making the scenarios build on each
  other in a more natural fashion. The changes are not fully completed
  yet but seem to be in the right direction.

  AI-0810a: Donal to look into the relation of the EPS and CDL
            (retrieval, update, etc). (Eventually this should probably
            become a separate scenario.)
