* OGSA Version 1.0 and Glossary status

  Discussed status and process to finalization: OGSA version 1.0 still
  has an incompletely updated EMS section. The Glossary may be
  affected by this update.
  
  It was agreed that this review was final for the other parts of the
  two documents and that a subsequent (partial) review should be done
  just for the updated text. Subsequent reviews to be done by email:
  to the list and to each person mentioned on the Authors list.

  Target submission is as soon as possible and definitely within
  January.

  The OGSA version 1.0 and Glossary are to be submitted to the Editor
  together. Their submission will also be coordinated with the CMM
  document submission, in so far as determining and using the final
  GFD numbers in the citations.

** Glossary

   Document walkthrough of draft 8 (not on gridforge yet)

   Jem has accepted all changes from previous edits. Changes showing
   are those from Hiro and from some comments from Olegario.

   - Some additions of terms for consistency and also to put
     definitions against the shorter entry.
   - Naming update: deleted 'uniquely' from the general definition
     (ref: Andrew's mail)
   - Deferred discussion around 'task' until the EMS section is finalized.

   - Agreed to remove 'lightweight' from the SOAP definition
   - Agreed to remove initial sentence from 'Security considerations.' 
     It is not a valid reason for security considerations not being
     applicable.
   
   - To update the GFD for the CMM document (when known)

   Jem will upload a new draft to gridforge and wait for the final
   version of the OGSA document.
   

** OGSA version 1.0

   Document walkthrough of draft 21 (from gridforge)

   Changes are relative to the version submitted for public
   comment. (And will be accepted for the next draft.)

   - Abstract updated to be more specific on what the document covers.
   - Copyright and IPR statement moved to the back
   - Added Glossary mention as well as Glossary section pointing to
     the Glossary document.
   - Changed the statement about the next version being a
     recommendation to more general statement about recommendation
     documents (to reflect current consensus).
   - Discussed Ian's comment about defining virtualization
     further. Agreed that it is not necessary to go in more detail at
     the moment (not beyond what's in this document and the Glossary)

   - To update the copyright notice: 2002-2005
   - Lighter color scheme for Figures 1-3 is better but some text is
     still difficult to read. Agreed to review figures for legibility
     once more and make sure the text is clearly visible.
   - Agreed to change "SOAP as the primary transport" to "SOAP as the
     primary message exchange format" in infrastructure services.
   - Agreed to change the examples after the "unit of work to be
     managed" in EMS to specifically state "OGSA application or
     legacy." (And will revisit this section for a final review)
   - Discussed 'job is a resource' statement and agreed that some
     clarification is necessary; re-arranging text to put this
     statement to the end of the paragraph might be clearer.
   - Need to revisit spelling once more to make sure it is only US
     spelling as agreed in previous reviews (some words still remain).
   - CIM/WBEM is ok as is (even though it should really be just WBEM).
   - Naming udner Information services is not updated yet. Andreas to
     update according to Andrew's email.
   - References: [OGSA RM] bookmark seems broken. Andreas to update.

   Andreas will upload a new (hopefully final) version and mail
   authors and the list for a final review.
