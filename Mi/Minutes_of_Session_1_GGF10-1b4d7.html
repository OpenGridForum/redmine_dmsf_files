<p><font face="Verdana">Minutes of the 1st CGS-WG Session<br>
GGF10, Berlin<br>
12-March-2004, 1030</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Larry Flon called the meeting to order, and introduced 
Tom Roney as the new co-chair of the group.&nbsp; Tom took notes for the 
meeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Larry briefly reviewed the history of the group, and the 
plan for this and the 2nd session.&nbsp; He then introduced Andrea Westerinen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Andrea gave a presentation on the DMTF and the history 
and future of CIM.&nbsp; Some discussion followed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Larry then proposed a Workshop for GGF11 on CIM, and 
there was general interest among the group in attendance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In the context of the workshop, it was suggested that we 
should add to the agenda a discussion of using CIM for job monitoring and/or 
workflow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Demos would be interesting if time permits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">We should discuss UML and modeling, not just the 
intracacies of MOF.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Fred Maciel suggested We avoid using the term CIM in the 
title of the workshop.&nbsp; John Tollefsrud, our AD, agrees.&nbsp; Larry 
suggested something like:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workshop on a Common 
Information Model</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Tom would like to hold the workshop more than one time, 
John suggested he get support from the GROC.</font></p>
