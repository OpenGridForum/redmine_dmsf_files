Summary of conference call August 31, 2004

  In attendance:

    Larry Flon         <flon@isi.edu>
    Viktor Mihajlovski <mihajlov@de.ibm.com>
    Susan Malaika      <malaika@us.ibm.com>
    Andrea Westerinen  <andreaw@cisco.com>

Larry reminded Andrea that the GGF12 CIM Overview CGS 
sessions had been shifted to 2 on Wednesday and 1 on
Thursday.  Andrea stated that this would impact some DMTF
travel plans.  Larry and Susan agreed to revert to the 3 
Wednesday sessions for the CIM Overview, and the work 
session on Thursday morning.  This conflicts with Susan's
InfoD session, but she will work around that.

Larry also reminded Andrea that the CGS sessions are 90 
minutes long, not 75 minutes as in Andreas's initial 
presentation schedule.  Andrea agreed to re-do the timing 
for those sessions to use the full periods.

Larry asked Andrea for presenter BIOS, and suggested that 
we put together a 1-page insert for the registration packet 
containing the CIM session outlines, schedule, and bios.  
Larry will contact Steve Crumb about distributing these, 
and linking to this in a future GGF announcement email.

Also, it was suggested we send email to the OGSA-WG with the 
same info.
