3) Progress Report.

Stephen and Dave have drafted revised EMS/Data scenarios

4) Discussion of EMS/Data scenarios

- add wrapper symbol to diagram guide
- add motivation section, explaining that use of JSDL+RNS abstracts underlying implementation, allowing performance optimisations and/or use of alternative components.  Also that WS allow different implementations to communicate; also that SOAP should not be used for large-scale data transfer.
- number the scenarios
- change "comments" to "steps" and number the items
- explain more about the dotted RNS box
- make data transfer in the last scenario go between resources
- BES and DTS may be implemented by the same software component

Stephen and Dave to revise the EMS/Data scenarios document.
