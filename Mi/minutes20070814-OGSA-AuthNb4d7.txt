Notes: Michel Drescher

- Allen gives a brief overview of the current status of the OGSA-AuthN 
  design team
- Allen outlines which OGF working groups a should be contacted for joint 
  work and collaboration for AuthN
- OGSA extends existing AuthN standards to include discovery mechanisms
- Steve N comments that there is a lot of corporate security infrastructures
  that may not interoperate.
  Already deployed infrastructure will not swap their whole security 
  infrastructure.
  -- Allan agrees with that. 
- The difficult question is how to enable already existing, internal security 
  infrastructures with global, interoperable security infrastructures.
- Even though there are IGTF accredited security profiles for AuthN, how
  can we ensure that institutions adopt those profiles, or how can we even 
  collect the knowledge that an institution actualy *does* implement at least
  one of those profiles at all?
- Allan proposes an Action Item to implement example of discovery of IGTF 
  profile implementations
  -- Steve N comments that this action item would be a corner case of the work
     that should be done in OGSA-AuthN
- The current situation having to use the IGTF accredited profile implementors
  is clearly undesirable.
