* Secure Transport Document
	- Hiro things that C0400 is optional
		-- Duane agrees and agrees that this claim CAN be removed.
		-- Hiro likes the structure for Hostname Verification (4.3)
			-- Can Duane do the same thing for client verification above it?
				-- ACTION ITEM:  Duane to do this
	- Re: R0408
		-- Hiro wants the first paragraph of 5.1.1 to be conformance claim.
			-- ACTION ITEM:  Duane to do this
		-- The lines following the XML does not have conformance targets and
			(ACTION ITEM) Duane will add this in.
		-- The conformance claim should also say something about, "If you use
			this type of authentication, you MUST follow this model."

		(just after Trademarks section).
		-- ACTION ITEM:  Duane to do this (and for the secure addressing doc)

		-- ACTION ITEM:  Hiro to send Duane the text that he would like to
			see for this paragraph.
	- Line 185
		-- Hiro is not sure that this is an extension of Secure Addressing, but
			rather a restriction of it.
			-- The mechanisms for embedding secure tokens are needed by this
				document.  Specifically the part where it extends
				WS-SecurityPolicy is required by this document.
			-- (ACTION ITEM) Duane to change work extension to the word
				restriction on line 185 (section 3.2)

* Secure Addressing
	- Lines 225 through 231
		-- Hiro can't find Conformance claims for these targets.
			-- ACTION ITEM:  Duane to move these to the definitions section.

* Last Call Notice
