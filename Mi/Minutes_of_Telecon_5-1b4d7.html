<UL>
  <LI><B>1. Agenda bhashing<BR></B>No changes to the agenda were<B> 
  </B>made<B><BR></B></LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><B>2. Changes in the draft</B><BR>Ellen reported working on changes in the 
  Visio: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Two new attributes: <BR>1.) Scheduledpriority (priority set by the 
    scheduler which may be differetn than the the priority set by the 
    user)<BR>2.) JobWallTimeUsed (number of seconds that a job queued) 
    <LI>Two new associations between system and batchJob:<BR>1.) Execution 
    candidate (relationship between a batch job and one or more nodes capable of 
    running the job)<BR>2.) ExecutionTarget (showing that the job is running on 
    one or more nodes)<BR><BR>Associations to System are inherited to 
    computersystem and cluster. It was noted that the cluster modell is being 
    changed and that <BR>we should keep an eye on these changes in respect to 
    this association.&nbsp; 
    <LI>Deleted association between batchQueue and batchSAP because it seems to 
    be unneccesary<BR><BR></LI></UL>
  <LI><B>3. Open questions:&nbsp;</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>separate class for statistics?<BR>all agreed that this makes sense 
    <LI>additional types of managed properties:<BR>a. description of task to be 
    executed: script/command/program, parameters, recovery options, managementof 
    output<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; Discussed the possibilities of one freeform 
    descrition attribute vs. one attribute with compound syntax vs.<BR>&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; several attributes for this. No final decision. Ellen will get back 
    to the person who introduced this idea.<BR>b. userid of the user to 
    impersonate for job execution<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; All agreed that such a 
    pointer to user data will be needed. In future the user and security classes 
    will<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; be modified segregating the White Pages information 
    from the security information. We agreed that in this<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    context the security information is more relevant. Again something to watch. 
    Another input was that the<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; proxy-certificate impersonation 
    defined in GSI should be taken into account. <BR>c. failure/success 
    condition on return code<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not needed to be added 
    since this is already in the abstract class job from which batchJob is 
    derived<BR>d. recovery options: stop, re-run, etc<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; All 
    agreed that this is a good idea and needs to be included. It should be a 
    ENUM of about 6 reasonable<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; options. Ellen will again check 
    back with the person who ntroduced this idea. <BR><BR>In general it was 
    remarked that such discussions should be taken to the list at first, before 
    discussing them<BR>in the telcon<BR><BR>
    <LI>BatchJobGroup vs. work flow<BR>Is there a simplified concept for 
    grouping jobs, e.g. for ordering, without having to go into the ratholes of 
    workflow modelling? The idea is to start<BR>and experiment with something 
    simple before getting to the work flow stuff. Could the Unix pipe model 
    help? No that is rather implementational stuff. Decision was to take this to 
    the list.&nbsp; 
    <LI>properties of BatchService<BR>Again this should be taken to the list 
    three people on the phone are too few to get decisions on this. We need 
    input about the actual schedulars. 
    <LI>other comments on the new draft<BR>No other comments.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; 
    </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Any other business<BR></B>After some emails going forth and back Ellen 
  was chosen to be the representative of GGF in the liaison with DMTF. It seems 
  that the batchJob modell<BR>can be included into CIM 2.8. which will be out as 
  preliminary in spring and thus finalized end of next year.<BR></LI></UL>
<P>The next Telecon of the CGS-WG is scheduled for 8AM Pacific on Tuesday 17, 
2002.&nbsp; Dial-in information will be forthcoming. Since Ellen and others will 
take holidays, we decided that the following Telcon will be January 21, 
2003<BR>&nbsp;</P><BR></BODY>
