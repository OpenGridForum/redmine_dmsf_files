<p><font face="Verdana">Minutes of the 2nd CGS-WG Session<br>
GGF10, Berlin<br>
12-March-2004, 1600</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Larry opened the meeting and reviewed the agenda.&nbsp; 
Fred Maciel took notes for the meeting.</font></p>
<div align="left">
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Andrea presented some remaining hanging 
  issues with the JSIM Specification.&nbsp; It was agreed to accept her changes.&nbsp; 
  A clarification was agree to on the fact that MaxCPUTime and CPUTime are 
  properties for an individual run, in the case of a recurring job, not for the 
  total runs of the job.</font></div>
<p><font face="Verdana">Larry and Andrea will work to update the document and 
UML before it is officially published by the GGF.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Andrea will submit changes to the DMTF in time for CIM&nbsp; 
2.9. She also stated there will be a 2.10 release before a 3.0 release, which is 
probably where any SRIM changes will appear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Susan Malaika began a presentation of the DAIS Use Cases 
document.&nbsp; A lively discussion ensued.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">CIM does not currently have support for either logical 
or physical database schema.&nbsp; The DMTF database working group is developing 
support for the physical storage representation of database.&nbsp; So the CGS-WG 
should plan to develop both schemas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Some discussion occured around the question, raised by 
Larry, of whether administration of the database schema and/or user/access 
control through CIM could translate into CIM actions that would make those 
changes to the database.&nbsp; Thus DAIS might do administration via CIM in one 
particular way, and there might be support to accomplish this in Oracle, DB2, 
SQL Server, etc., which would be wonderful for DAIS but would require active 
support from the database vendors (and this would need their support anyway, to 
store the database schema info in the CIMOM).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">We ran out of time at this point.&nbsp; Larry intends to 
continue the discussion of the mail list, and via bi-weekly telecons, to be 
negotiated on the mail list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Andrea stated that there were good concepts discussed 
here. We need CIM database specialists to participate in the discussion, and 
Andrea will facilitate this.&nbsp; This is in line with the CGS-WG general 
desire to involve the DMTF in GGF.</font></p>
