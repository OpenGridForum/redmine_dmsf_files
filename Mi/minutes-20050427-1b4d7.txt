  Revision by Jem posted on gridforge.
  
  Sec.2, p4-5: "OGSA Compliance Tests" : Does this mean a compliance
         suite, or simply a description of what tests should be
         performed.  "Practical criteria" seems to change the initial
         meaning (suite) to something else.

     Ultimately it will need to reflect GGF's position on the
     development of compliance test suites.
     
     Action: Jem to raise as issue in the tracker.  (Done)

  Sec. 2.2, p5: First sentence. Hiro wants to add a sub-subsection to
       describe other normative documents that are part of OGSA. This
       sentence seems a bit strange.

    p6: "... initial set of three such profiles..."
         Remove list and revise along the lines of "define some
         profiles" and give the ones listed there as examples. They
         may be augmented later.

    - 'Extension' is probably a better term than 'add-on' or 'higher
      level' profile to describe profiles 'using' other profiles.

    - The OGSA profile definition reference comes at the end and seems
      a bit late. This section is a summary of that document and this
      fact does not come out clearly enough. For example 'adoption'
      and 'status' are mentioned but it is not clear that they are
      defined in more detail in the referenced document.

    Action: Consider changing the place of the citation and making
            clearer what information is in the referenced
            document. (Jem)
  
  Sec. 2.4: Agreed that this is a placeholder and will not try to
       revise further at this time.  Hiro and Dave are working on a
       document within the GFSG. This section will be updated once the
       GFSG document is completed.

       Action: Jem to accept visible changes for now.

** Review of template for 'development schedule' sections

   - Change 'interface' to 'document' since not all specs define
     interfaces. For example, JSDL defines a document type.

   - Agreed not to add non-GGF OGSA related spec schedules here.

   - Proposal to change the name of the "Basic Profile" to something
     else.
     - This is not a roadmap document issue. It should be raised
       against the BP tracker.

     Action: Steven to submit the title change as an issue on the BP
             tracker. (Done)

   - The target is for each summary to be one page or less.

   - Basic profile referenced specs: The status is the **expected
     status** of those specification when the BP is likely to go into
     public comment. 

     The status of the referenced specs will have to be fixed later
     on, when the roadmap document comes closer to submission. Also
     the roadmap document itself will have to be updated periodically.

   Action: Jem to add a statement that OGSA-WG will update the roadmap
           document periodically since it contains information that
           may change over time.
  
  - Candidates for provinding information for each section:
    - Data Architecture: Dave B, Allen L.
    - ByteIO: Mark M
    - BES: Andrew/Darren Pulsipher/Steven N
    - WS-Agreement: Karl C or Chris S
    - JSDL: Andreas 
    - RNS: Andrew 
    - ACS: Should ACS be included in this list or not? It is related
           to the EMS architecture but it is not used by any profile
           at the moment. If ACS is added then maybe related efforts
           such as CDDLM or other EMS activities should also be added.
      - Need to make criteria for inclusion in the roadmap document
        clearer. Revisit this issue.
    - Basic Profile: Tom M
    - Naming Profile: Andrew
    - Data Profile: Dave B
    - Basic EM profile: Hiro
    - Security Profile: Frank S     
      - But it is not clear that a separate security profile is being
        planned. Hiro to confirm.

  Action: Candidates need to be confirmed. Hiro to follow up.

  Action: Jem will revise and upload the next version of the roadmap
          document. He will also merge in any new information provided
          using the template draft.
