* Action items review

 AI-0508a: Donal to get in contact with Taverna Drill
           use cases for cyclic dependency declarations

Donal has sent out overview of Taverna to the list and
also will explain at today's session. AI closed.

Since "cyclic dependency" is not covered, new AI specific
to "cyclic dependency" is created but no one takes charge
of it.

 AI-0726a (new): Show typical/existing use cases for cyclic 
           dependency declarations
           (spawned from AI-0508a, owner unspecified)

             the Berlin GGF

* Taverna workflows by Donal Fellows

Taverna is not service oriented workflow but data oriented workflow.
It is actually data & control oriented workflow.
Taverna is scientific oriented, underneath medical or pharmaceuticals
resource managements are expected to be free to use.
There is no run time authorization mechanism.
However a workflow should go through ethics committee and it requires
human intervention.

How much work will be necessary to Tavarna people adopt standards?
It should not be BPEL, Taverna is very very different from BPEL.
BPEL workflow document is easy to becomes very large but
Taverna is much sophisticate than BPEL.

Taverna has very unique view for how to model. They don't depend
specific execution environment but use specific meta date.

* Next step

Donal thinks it is remote chance to succeed workflow standard.
No one wants to achieve workflow interoperability.

Chris Kantarjiev says interoperability is out of our scope.
Donal agrees.

Control job dependency is in-scope.
Donal thinks it is rather components dependency.
Exapmle is just run posix jobs.
Donal thinks Steve wants to stay simple cases.

Hiro says we work on community practice document as fast track.
Consensus is "focus community practice document" (fast track).
Job dependency (2nd track) should be postponed and focus community 
practice document.

* OGF21 session plan

OGSA-WG will request 5 sessions including workflow.
If it is not necessary, we can cancel it later.

Chris K, our AD, is ok to submit 5 session request. Hiro will do so 
shortly.
