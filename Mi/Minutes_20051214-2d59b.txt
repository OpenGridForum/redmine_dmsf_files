3) Progess & planning update

Dave to investigate Skype or phone for OGSA Data session at F2F.

GFS has booked a session at GGF16, so there is no need for us to arrange this.

4) Naming and RNS

We discussed whether this specification meets our needs and we have particular needs that we need to pass on.  We also discussed whether we think people will implement this specification.

On the first question, the RNS spec seems to have the expressive power that we need.  The text seems oriented towards naming static data sources and to file systems.  It would help if we had an example that showed how RNS would name transient data or a query result that isn't materialised at the time of naming.

On the second question, we agreed that the spec seems to be too complicated.  Our concern is twofold.  First, the complicated spec may discourage people from implementing it (as has happened with other proposed WS specs).  Second, the spec includes elements that should be separated into composable elements that may have uses beyond the RNS scenario.  E.g. iteration is a general concept (and we may be able to use WS-Enumeration).  Logical names are also being addressed by WS-Names; in general it may be possible to compose the human-readable names with any suitable spec for logical names.

Mark to post UVa's "RNS-lite" document, requesting people to comment.

Stephen to investigate whether transient data is supported.

Allen & Dave to draft message to GFS & ADs, saying RNS is too complicated.


5) GFS Architecture document

We discussed whether the GFS document could this be a use case for our generic architecture.

The GFS documents basically seem to describe requirements, aspirations and design issues.  Some of the services that we've described should address a major part of the GFS requirements, but probably not all.  

We agreed that the GFS work was valuable.  It would be good to discuss with the GFS people whether the services we describe could implement part of their architecture, and what parts would remain for future work.

Allen & Dave to mail GFS saying that we want to collaborate on architectural design.
