* Presentation: Information/data modeling XQuery (Ellen, 30 min)

  - Ellen presented slides on XQuery Example:
    o Tools support newer version of XQuery. Oxygen XML alterative brought up.
  - Collections need to be discussed in more detail: Span multiple organizations.
  - XQuery supports full name space and types (schema)
  - Jay suggest the use of functions
  - Chart 9: find me a top level resource (cluster or machine)
  - Chart 10: find me a resource anywhere that satisfies the need.
    "/*" is key difference between 9 and 10.
  - Michel's text shown with function example (posted to list).
    o Cleaner looking and also capable of merging
    o XQuery is much like a scripting/programming language
      * Security issue discussion on downloaded job xml - needs to be explored more
    o XML query added to job document - this is the next step
  - Discussion on if a requirements XML document could be constructed with
    powerful comparative expressions and at same time avoids the XPath expressions/joins on collecting input
    documents?  Perhaps just the relevant subset of a query in job.
  - Agreed to discuss more in second hour on Next Call - Oct 19th

* Separation of service/info model
  - Postponed

* BES Appendix Discussion (Ellen/Mark)
  - Discussion on removal of BES Spec appendix.  Mark to talk with Andrew tomorrow and
    will check with BES WG on intro section.  This will be discussed further on next
    BES Telecon or via mailing list
  - Options Discussed and consensus is: OGSA publishes container model as a separate informational
    document w/BES review.  It would be less specific than BES.
