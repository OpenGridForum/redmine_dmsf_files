* Genesis II BES Implementation
* HPC Profile and Interop Planning
	- Groups interested in participating
		-- Microsoft (existing)
		-- UVA
			--- Genesis II (existing)
			--- Humphrey (existing)
		-- Platform
		-- ICL -- GridSam group (existing)
		-- Fujitsu
		-- Globus
	- SC2006 is less than two months away
	- Maybe we can get some people who don't want to host implementations, to host hardware
	- The process of interop testing between now and SC is more subject to risks then the demo itself.
	- We need a coordinater to carry the flag.  Volunteers?
		-- Microsoft volunteers
			--- To work on the HPC Profile mailing list.
	- Telecons with screen sharing
	- Three facets
		-- Technical facet
		-- Legal Facets
		-- Press Facets
	- Propose that we punt the marketing aspects to OGF and Steve Crumb
	- In terms of Legal, that not something that UVa cares about -- it should be one of the Vendors (maybe Microsoft or Platform)
* Should we make the lifetime explicitly undefined, or make it undefined unless there is an attribute in the container
	- Maybe define a few attributes
	- We have consensus to have an attribute
	- Tom suggests looking at ResourceTransfer which has metadata about lifetime management.
	- How about a hybrid.  There is metadata in the create wrapper which identifies how long the client wishes for the activity to hang around, but its optional so you don't have to do it.
	- Proposals
		-- Do nothing, just say it's undefined
		-- An optional container level attribute that says how long information is persisted (minimum)
		-- Make it an extensible parameter on the create
		-- Combine the middle two together.
		-- Vote by majority is to leave it out and will talk about an extension later
			-- Action Item:  Andrew to add the sentence to the create activity operation that says that the lifetime is explicitly undefined
* URI vs. String argument in the HPC profile file/path names
	Vote, Strings win, not URIs
* Trackers, as per gridforge
