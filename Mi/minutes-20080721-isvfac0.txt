  Possible sessions:
  - ISV adoption: The document should be over or almost over its
    public comment by that time
    - Joint session with GLUE and how it could be used in this
      setting?  (This also relates to the next topic, information
      services)
      - Hiro will ask Sergio if anything is planned by GLUE
  - Information services: Andrew is one of the stakeholders and he
    will not be present. Might still be possible if the sessions is
    arranged early morning: 9am Singapore is 9pm East coast.
  - WSRF BP Interop experience document: It is a small topic; might be
    possible to take a few minutes from another session
  
  In brief, seems like two sessions
  1. ISV (+ glue) 
  2. Information services

  Hiro will post proposal to list. If there is no consensus on the
  list might arrange to have another call Thursday (late slot)

* ISV document review

  - Steven has not received any feedback since the last call
  - Agreed that overall it looks good and is ready to go to final call

  Minor revisions:
  - Delete DRMAA column from table (different technology base from the
    rest) and refer to DRMAA web site as it already has this kind of
    information
  - Revised table by Hiro
    - Reordered the columns and aggregated yes/no rows
    - Can scenario 4 handle disconnected operation? Yes, via external
      storage server.
      - What is key difference between scenarios 4&5? Two-way steering

    Agreed to include the table with minor changes:
    - Add two-way steering
    - Swap columns/rows to make it fit in one page

  - WS-Security section: change title to "Security specifications ..."
    for clarity. And minor textual change for OGF profiles
  - HTC term is used twice but no explanation or motivation for its
    use. Agreed it's clearer to change to "Remote Computing"

  - Add captions to tables (above) and figures (below)
  - Add Abstract
  - Line 721 "[OTHERS]" delete
  - Line 738 "GLOBAL ..." change to "OPEN ..."
  - Add References: Ok to do so after the final call
  - Change to GWD-I

  - Steven will put it out to final call asap.
  - Plan is to try and be just about out of public comment by OGF24
