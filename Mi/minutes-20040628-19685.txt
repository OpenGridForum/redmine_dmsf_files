==================================

* Participants

  Abdeslem Djaoui (RL)
  Hiro Kishimoto (Fujitsu)
  Andreas Savva (Fujitsu)
  Frank Siebenlist (ANL)
  Jem Treadwell (HP)
  Jay Unger (IBM) (part of the call)

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* OGSA 1.0 document review

  - Changed task to job

  - Security section (3.6.3): Two Figures and their associated text
    seem to be a bit out of sync.
     
    Action: Andreas and Frank to work on revising the security section
            by the next call.
      
* Terminology review

  - Job as service or WS-resource. (A component that participates in a
    SOA is a service)

  - Agreement: Jem to follow up with GRAAP-WG using Frank's proposed
    text.

  - Add 'message' and broaden definition of 'messaging service' to
    cover more than notification (Bill)

  - Message broker: re-check the OGSA document usage and consider
    adding

  - Data source: taken from the data glossary. 'multiple' does not
    seem right. Jem to wordsmith entryl

  - Remove all entries that do not appear in the OGSA doc for this
    submission. But keep them since we may come back to use them in
    later

  - Andreas to review the self-management text
