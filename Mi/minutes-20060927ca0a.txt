Regarding future directions, for AutoDetect:  Network and assign role via one 
of these mechanisms:

1 - General Purpose
2 - Human in the loop
3 - Assigned by pre-registration - perhaps harder when large number of 
    devices are in flux.  In Human brain, hundreds of thousands of cells die 
    every day.  Could be an organizer or departmental server which is in 
    charge of aligning the device.  Multi-layer autonomy.

Ebay notes that Manageability requirement was number one reason for purpose 
grid standards.

Goal: Self-maintain data center

Perhaps WSRT - or other standard could be used?

Some things to consider in researching hardware/software:
- Instant On PCs/Servers
- Zen/VMWare
- OpenBoot

Keisuke believes that for the mega class data center with tens of thousand 
servers should be managed as self-maintained units of even smaller human cell 
like components  -  numbers of cells are dying and newly added every day 
without being noticed in a macro level; data center components should be 
treated like this and the services running should be insulated from the base 
infrastructure hardware. Auto Discovery and Auto Deployment (Provisioning) should be the parts of the technologies.

Can detect something via network - MAC address - need to have an Orientation 
Agent.  Might tie into scheduler?
(1) AutoDiscovery 
(2) AutoDeployment for newly inserted blades
- What existing type of technology exist today?  
- Combine this with ACS to complete the AP.

Expand Use-Case in ACS Future.  Need to take a look at PeteÅfs Use-Case.

Next conference: Not determined. Group work on e-mail basis and the call will 
                 be schedule on demand.
