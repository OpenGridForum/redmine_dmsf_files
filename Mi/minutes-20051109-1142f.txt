* Updates and From now on
   - Keisuke will attend the OASIS SDD TC Face-to-face meeting at the week of 
     Nov 14. SDD has started refining use cases they gathered, which contain

     about 150 items. It is expected to have a set of baseline requirements
     at the end of the meeting. How the spec details will be, i.e. how it 
     will be different from the original IUDD spec, is still vague, 
     so it is not yet the time to start discussion about relationship with ACS.

   - Mike reported the joint EMS discussion at the OGSA telconf on Nov 9.
     One of the main issues related to ACS is where RSS expects to be able
     to get information from in order to generate a candidate set of deployment
     target. It could be ACS or Information Service. This discussion will
     continue, and we are going to be get more involved in them after we 
     release our first specification.

   - We agreed to do a brainstorming about the remained issues from now on.
    - Meta data
      Mike suggested that AA instance to have resource property to describe
      meta data of application and that kind of information may be added
      dynamically after AA instance is created using the WSRF operations.
    - Relationship with SDD TC.
    - Relationship with OGSA-EMS.
    - Reference implementation. We may expect the feedback from Business
      Grid Project team. Mike also has plan to develop implementation of ACS.

* Next meeting
   Date & Time: will be announced later
   Note: we agreed to skip next week.
   Keisuke will ask Tom and Pete whether they have preferences for the teleconf
   schedule. Mike and Sachiko have no preference.
