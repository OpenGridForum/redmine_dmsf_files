1. JSDL
=======
- Andreass gives an update on JSDL
- same sliddeset as given at OGF19
- Andrew: There are a number of BES and hence JSDL implementations out there
  -- This "user base" must be respeccted
- Andrew iterates on the DataStaging element in JSDL 1.0 and its semantics
  -- How does this influence JSDDL 2.x?
  -- current implementation is an easy way to describe dat preconditions 
     and data postconditions
  -- The group discusses the different approaches on
     --- pre-/post-conditions
     --- requirements/cappabilities 
  -- Andrew proposes that pre- and post-conditions are separate elements in 
     a JSDL document sibling to requirements/capabilities
  -- Which information should be in requirements, and which in pre-conditions?
  -- Fabio: Concerns expressed about how one job can express a dependency 
            upon the completion of a second job
  -- Andreas: roll out proposed new JSDL features as extensions to V1.x. 
              Use this as a means to test proposed new JSDL features and then
              will be in a better position to define JSDL V2
- Jay: Propose to publish a draft of JSDL2
  -- new namespace, new schema
  -- selected new elements of JSDL 2 get back ports to JSDL 1.x
- The group agrees to nail down a very early draft of JSDL 2.0
  -- the specification for JSDL 2.0 will contain non-normative text, i.e.
     immplementation notes, rationales, etc.
- Jay: Propose to provide an XSLT that converts a JSDL 1.x <Resources> section 
  into JSDL 2.x requirements
  -- Rationale in this should include pointers to tooling that would help
     users creating the XQuery
- Andreas: Propose to allow non-XQuery requirements
- Andreas continues to give a mind map based overview about the issues 
  for JSDL 2


2. Information Model
====================
- Ellen introduces a draft set of XML tags for the Information Model
  -- Ellen provides some background information about info model work in
     BES and GLUE schema
- Dave: What's the virtue of using/starting out with the GLUE schema?
  -- Ellen: GLUE has been around for a while in Grid context, and fairly 
     wide adopted
  -- political opportunity to tag team with the GLUE-WG in OGF
- The group discusses the benefits and drawbacks why to start off on GLUE or not
- The group takes the GLUE schema 1.3 and starts to modify selected elements 
  to the Information Model needs
  -- This is not so much as to modify GLUE 1.3 but more of a profile excercise
     to further the Information Model work for a concrete tag list
