<title>Minutes of the 22-Oct-2002 CGS-WG teleconference</title>
</head>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 3rd CGS-WG telecon was held this morning 
(Pacific time). Attendees were:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Larry Flon (USC/ISI)<br>
  Jenny Schopf (ANL)<br>
  Viktor Mihajlovski (IBM Germany)<br>
  Andreas Maier (IBM Germany)<br>
  Tom Roney (NCSA)<br>
  Eric Woo (IBM Yorktown)<br>
  Peter Gietz (DAASI)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We reviewed the meetings at GGF6 in Chicago 
last week. There were 2 CGS-WG sessions and 1 joint session with DAMED/NM/CGS. 
The latter session was to figure out if/how these groups should interact. The 
DAMED group is shutting down (finished) and the NM group will work on a schema 
that might later be fed to CGS for translation to CIM.<br>
<br>
The first CGS-WG session reviewed the group charter and goals, and a brief intro 
to CIM Modeling was presented by Ellen Stokes of IBM. The second CGS-WG session 
reviewed the JSIM document, specifically the UML diagram. Various issues were 
raised that will be discussed on the mailing list.<br>
<br>
During today's call, we again discussed the issue of producing an XML 
representation of the MOF we deliver. Peter and Jenny suggested that it was a 
&quot;contract&quot; in our charter. Andreas suggested we wait for and make use of work 
that IBM is doing to algorithmically transform MOF into XSD. Larry said that 
even with an algorithm to do the translation, producing an XSD that is relevant 
and useful to the OGSA efforts will be a lot of work. This issue will be 
discussed on the mail list.<br>
<br>
Peter asked how decisions are made in a WG. Jenny said that any decisions made 
during meetings or calls should be reiterated to the mail list. We should 
establish a policy that decisions sent to the mail list have a 2 week deadline 
for responses. If no significant objections are raised during this period, then 
the decision will stand. (Of course it can always be changed later on).<br>
<br>
The issue of job dependencies/workflow was raised during the second CSG-WG 
session at GGF6. During this call, the sense was that we don't want to dive into 
this problem as part of this WG right now. This issue will be raised to the mail 
list.<br>
<br>
The JSIM UML shows the BatchQueue attached to the OperatingSystem. In grid 
environments, the job queue belongs to a job scheduler/execution system, not 
directly to the OS. There can be multiple schedulers, and one scheduler can have 
multiple queues. Andreas, Viktor and Ellen will work on an update to the UML 
that will be posted to the mail list in advance of the next call.<br>
<br>
There was some discussion about the &quot;clarity&quot; of the UML. Andreas advocated use 
cases. Peter asked that the UML be made as clear as possible. Andreas stated 
that UML by itself is not a complete story.<br>
<br>
The next CGS-WG call will be in two weeks (5 NOV). The agenda will roughly be to 
review discussions and decisions made on the mail list over the next two weeks, 
and to review the updated UML that will be posted.<br>
<br>
Peter proposed that Larry become the official CGS-WG Secretary, and there was no 
objection. Peter will update the charter accordingly.<br>
