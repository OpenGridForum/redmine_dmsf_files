OGSA Teleconference - 12 February 2007 - Slot 2
===============================================

* Participants

   Mike Behrens (R2AD)
   Chris Kantarjiev (Oracle)
   Hiro Kishimoto (Fujitsu)
   Andreas Savva (Fujitsu)
   Alan Sill (TTU)
   Ellen Stokes (IBM)
   Jem Treadwell (HP)

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* Topic of this call: General/Logistics

* Action items review - postponed

* OGF19 review

  - One major topic was Security. Trying to start up AuthN-WG, also
    additional work on federated identity, etc.
    - There is a question on the OGSA Basic Secure Profile, and
      whether it should be called 'basic'. There is, for example, no
      relationship with TLS while there are statements about EPRs
      which are less well adopted.
      - TLS (in industry) is de-facto; not using x.509. This is part
        of larger ongoing discussion
    - Hiro is now talking with the authors of the profile and a
      followup discussion is expected at the end of the next call
      (Thursday)
    - The AuthN discussion is set to continue in the proposed AuthN-WG
      - Other (HPC etc) discussion will probably continue either
        within OGSA or in other WGs
  - Another important topic was Workflow. Work is starting up on two
    topics and there is a call scheduled.

** Approved OGF19 General part minutes only

* March F2F update

  - The F2F dates were fixed at OGF19 to March 14-16. There is an
    updated wiki page.

  - There are some problems getting conference rooms at that time.
    - Oracle - full; request waitlisted [got rooms later]
    - Fujitsu - full
    - Hitachi - Hiro asked Fred; waiting 
    - IBM - Ellen put hold on rooms - It is North San Jose [Later
      confirmed that there is no outside connectivity]
    - Also to look at  other possibilities
      - Intel (Hiro to ask Ravi)
      - eBay (Ask Paul)
      - HP (Maybe a bit further away and not sure if there is a local
        participant)

* OGF20
  - This is a plenary style OGF. It is likely that the WG will have
    fewer slots in the main session
  - Agreed to request a room at the University for a F2F on Friday
