* Tracker Review
  - Closed obsolete artf6008 on "The Action List" tracker 
  - Document reorganization also makes current security profile
    trackers obsolete.
  - Reviewed previous document trackers and identified issues that may
    still apply to the new documents. Closed obsolete ones.

  ACTION: Andreas to create trackers for new security profile
          documents; move over identified issues; and delete old
          trackers

* Document structure

  - Discussed whether use case document should be moved forward
    together with the profiles. 
    - Agreed that the use cases cover wider area than the profiles. It
      is difficult to move forward on the use cases at this time. 
    - The document does over offer valuable input to security area. It
      may be worth handing it over to another group, if one exists.

  CONSENSUS: Focus only on the profile documents at this time

  ACTION: Duane to talk with Blair Dillaway (Security AD) about
          handing the use case document to another group

  Andreas moved the old documents (except the use cases) to the Attic

** Naming of documents

   - Discussed naming and breakdown of profiles. 
     - Which profile is more basic and should include the bsp claim
       URI required to fill the gap for the WSRF Basic Profile be
       exposed?
     - Should these profiles be called OGSA profiles?

   Agreed that they profiles are not specific OGSA---remove the OGSA
   branding from the title and rewrite so that they are OGSA
   neutral. In particular some of the conformance targets like
   OGSA_RESOURCE would have to be relabeled. Otherwise, it is ok to
   leave the profile claim URIs include '/ogsa/' since that only
   refers to the name of the WG producing the document.

   Agreed that a third short profile that will be OGSA specific should
   be produced. It will include in essence two conformance claims to
   bring the other two profiles together and also expose the WSRF
   basic security profile conformance claim URI.

   ACTION: Dave Snelling to prepare material (notes or draft) on how
           to write up the third OGSA specific security profile and
           send to Duane Merrill

* Logistics

  - Next security profile call will be next Monday
  - Agreed to cancel the logistics call on Thursday
