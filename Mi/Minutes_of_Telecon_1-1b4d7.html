<h2>1. Agenda</h2>
Following Agenda was agreed upon:
<ol>
<li>Introductory round (who am I, what is my interest in CIM based Grid Schema, please try to be short) 
<li>Agenda bashing (anything else to talk about today? anything we shouldn't talk about today?)

<ul>
<li>how many documents shall we produce? 
<li>who is willing to be editor / co-author?

<ul>
<li>Damed 
<li>OGSA
<li>Semantic Grid WG 
<li>other WGs
</ul>
<li>Are the chairs acceptable?
<li>Demo linux cluster software at next GGF
<li>Date of the next telephone conference
</ol>

<h2>2. Results of the discussions</h2>

<h3>Ad 1. Introductory round</h3>

Following people joined the conference:
<menu>
<li>Andreas Maier, IBM, member of the IBM OGSA activity
<li>Brian Tierney, LBL, interested in how this group will inluence the future of the DAMED WG
<li>Carl Kesselman, USC/Information Sciences Institute, involved in OGSA
<li>Dan Gunter, LBL, involved in DAMED WG
<li>Harvey Knapp, IBM involved in IBM NCSA project on cluster
<li>Jenny Schopf, ANL, part of the Globus team, involved in DAMED WG and GLUE Schema
<li>Joshi Fullop, NCSA, working on the CIM-based cluster monitor with the IBM SBLIM team
<li>Peter Gietz, DAASI International, interest in CIM for interoperability between different technologies
<li>Tom Roney, NCSA, working on Monitoring environment
<li>Victor Mihajlovsky, IBM, working on SBLIM, (CIM based linux cluster management tool)
</menu>

<h3>Ad 2: Agenda bashing</h3>

<p>one item on Linux cluster demo added to the agenda


<h3>Ad 3: Charter</h3>

<p>We want to be very focused to get the job done in the normal time frame of a GGF WGs (maximum 
18 month). Only then this work will be interesting for e.g. the OGSA WG, otherwise they will start 
their own effort on CIM schema.</p>

<p>Thus we decised to only work on one specific topic, being queues, or to use a more generic term Job 
submission interface.</p>

<p>We will produce two documents: 
<ol>
<li> one on defining CIM classes and their location in the overall CIM model on job submission interface, having OGSA requirements in mind
<li> one on how to map these classes to XML and to LDAP. If someone has interest, she could add a chapter on SQL mapping. The mappings could be                 devided in managability part  (reflecting operations, XML mapping to WSDL)           and information part (reflecting the mere  data, xml mapping to XML schema). 
</ol>

<p>Andreas is willing to lead the activities on the schema doc, Peter on the mapping document.


<h3>Ad 4: Other WGs</h3>

<p>OGSA WG should be seen as a customer of our efforts, especially XML mappings have to be in tune with OGSA

<p>DAMED WG will connect to our WG through a combined telephone conference 

<p>Semantic Grid WG should be contacted to offer them CIM as a technology that they could be using for their efforts


<h3>Ad 5: Chairs</h3>

<p>There were no objections concerning the proposed chairs Carl and Peter.


<h3>Ad 6: Demo on CIM based Linux cluster management tool</h3>

<p>The question was asked whether it was possible to have a 60 minute time slot at the next GGF for a demo. The reaction was that the WG time slot cannot be used for such a demo, since the group has too  much else to discuss. It was proposed to include such a demo in GGF 7, were there will be tutorials and similiar sessions. It could even be combined with a CIM tutorial.


<h3>Ad 7: date of next telephone conference</h3>

<p>Next telefone conference meeting will be agreed upon on the list. The majority agreed that we should schedule such a conference call twice a month.
