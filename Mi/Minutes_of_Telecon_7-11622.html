<ol>
  <LI><b>Open issues with the JSIM doc and how fast to proceed</b><p>Andrea and 
  Ellen discussed the latest version (dated 17 Feb 2003) of the JSIM, and agreed 
  to make certain modifications to the UML document and the MOF.&nbsp; Ellen 
  will update the group with the latest revisions. It is proposed that we 
  attempt completion of the JSIM by early June. This would mean that the 
  proposed model could be incorporated into the DMTF's next (2.8) &quot;train&quot; (see
  <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/download/about/239-snia_workflow.pdf">
  http://www.dmtf.org/download/about/239-snia_workflow.pdf</a>). </p>
  <p>Mid-March is the &quot;train&quot; for CIM 2.8 preliminary. So at GGF7 we'll need to 
  decide whether to propose what we have or wait another 6 months for 2.9 
  preliminary. Ellen is tempted to say we cut and run because after a 
  preliminary release there is a 6 month comment and use period to valid where 
  changes can be made before it's made final. </p>
  <p>Peter proposes in that case that the discussion on list and phone should be 
  high frequency until mid March </p>
  <p>Ellen says to expect a notification regarding a BOF at GGF7 (Wed night Mar 
  5) ... a proposed new work group would form to work on a Common Resource Model 
  to describe the structure of a manageable resource as an OGSA service as well 
  as a set of base resource (OGSA services) models. This group is spawned from 
  the work of the OGSA working group.<br>
&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI><b>Status of planned Demos at GGF7</b><p>The demos planned for GGF7 are 
  nearly complete. Tom must work further with Viktor to automate an event 
  response.<BR><BR>
  <LI><b>Dates for the next telecons</b></ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Peter has proposed a new schedule for the next CGS conference calls: (Mar 
  11, Mar 25, Apr 8, Apr 22, May 6, May 27).&nbsp; Two dates are a bit 
  problematic: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mar 11/18 <br>
    Some people may still be in Japan March 11, perhaps taking extra time to see 
    the sights. Others may need the time to catch up on work since being gone.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The meeting might be helpful to wrap up GGF7 results. Final decision to be 
  made on the list. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>May 20/27 <br>
    May 20 was skipped in favor of May 27, because Peter would not be able to 
    make the May 20 call. However, May 26 is a holiday in the U.S. and some 
    people may be extending the long weekend through the 27th. Who will be able 
    to make the call on the 27th? Enough to keep it scheduled? Or should we move 
    it up to May 20? May 20, seems to be more reasonable then.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<P>The CGS-WG has a bi-weekly teleconference on Tuesdays at these times:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>08.00-09.00 US Pacific (e.g. Los Angeles) <br>
09.00-10.00 US Mountain (e.g. Denver) <br>
10.00-11.00 US Central (e.g. Chicago) <br>
11.00-12.00 US Eastern (e.g. New York) <br>
16.00-17.00 GMT UK (e.g. London) <br>
17.00-18.00 Central Europe (e.g. Paris) <br>
01.00-02.00 Japan (next day) </P>
</blockquote>
<P>The next Telecon of the CGS-WG is scheduled for 8AM Pacific on Tuesday 
March 11, 
2003.&nbsp; The teleconference information is: </P>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>call-in number:</b> 1 888 709 8699<br>
  <b>international:</b> 1 773 799 3951<br>
  <b>passcode:</b> 79215</p>
