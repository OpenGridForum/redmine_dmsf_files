OGSA Teleconference - 12 April 2007 - EMS
=========================================

* Participants

  Donal Fellows
  Chris Kantarjiev
  Andreas Savva
  ZackK

  Minutes: Andreas Savva
  
* EMS Architecture Scenarios 1.0 Review

** Review of public comments 

   Three comments received. Main requests are for additional
   introductory text to help people not familiar with the
   specification, and some tidying up of acronyms and citations.

** Draft review

   Andreas is working on a draft to address the comments. The text
   introducing each specification is still in an early state and was
   not reviewed in detail.

   Agreed that the proposed changes are not major and do not require
   another teleconference. A final review can be done as part of the
   final call of the document.

* Next Steps

  Andreas will finish off the draft and issue a final call to the list
  early next week.

  Discussed plans for a next version; it is still too early. Some
  scenarios that were postponed were related to RSS and a new,
  significant, revision of the RSS specification is being prepared for
  OGF20 by Donal.
