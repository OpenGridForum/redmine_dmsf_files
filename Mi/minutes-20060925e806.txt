* EGA Reference Model Discussion

** Glossary
   - Jem gave an overview of his glossary presentation from GGF18;
     number of terms and overlaps (or non-overlap)
     - Explanatory (EGA) vs more formal/committee style (OGSA)
       definitions
     - Should also look for less obvious overlaps, beyond just
       same/different terms
     - Should probably define some new ones (e.g., Enterprise)
     - Possible editors for this work: Jem Treadwell & Paul Strong
     - Glossary convergence should be done in the context of other
       convergence work (i.e., Reference Model and OGSA)

   - The EGA reference model structure and verbosity of the Glossary
     is driven by the expected consumers of the documents. One reason
     that more text was pushed in the Glossary was to avoid excess
     overlap with definitions.
     - Might need to have taxonomony/ontology discussion to sort out
       things
     - Is a single Glossary possible? 
       - Probably no problem doing it. 
       - There is no way but to have a single Glossary

   - The OGSA Glossary is specific to the OGSA Architecture
     document---for scoping reasons. (In other words, it is not a
     general Grid or GGF Glossary.)

   - Occasionally there are 'battles' over common definitions of
     terms. Having an OGSA definition should not stop others from
     having their own definitions of terms.
     - Definitions of terms perceived to fall in this category are
       often prefixed with "In OGSA, " in the Glossary to make the
       context clear.

   - How to proceed? Wait for broader work to start?
     - No need to wait. Could start small, using email and then use
       the occasional call/F2F meeting to resolve remaining problems
     - In terms of process the OGSA list should be used

   AI-092625b: Jem to pull definitions together and produce a new
               merged first draft.
               - Send a mail to the ogsa list about this work 
               - Set Oct. 9 as the target for the first Glossary draft

   - Mike Behrens also volunteered to help out on the Glossary

   - Is everyone from EGA on the OGSA list? Maybe.
   - Are the EGA lists still active? The EGA alias does work and
     people have been invited to join

   AI-0925c: Hiro to ask Alan Clark to ask EGA TC member who want to
       contribute to join the OGSA list and this convergence work.
       - Members may have changed but organizations have not

   - Is the EGA Glossary available as an MS-Word file? It would
     simplify the work for the first draft. (The pdf version is
     otherwise sufficient.)
   
   AI-0925d: Paul Strong to send EGA Glossary MS-Word file to Jem
            Treadwell

   - From a more general perspective, it would be nice to have the EGA
     documents available on the OGF site.
     - This was assigned by OGF to the OGF Editor (Greg Newby). He is
       now reading the EGA documents.

** Reference Model and OGSA convergence

   - At GGF18 the proposal was to consider OGSA as a rendering of the
     EGA reference model. Agreed that this seems a good starting
     point. It should be tested by picking a candidate topic and see
     if it is really the case.
     - Hiro proposed the OGSA HPC Profile as a test case (a concrete
       use case)
     - The HPC Profile is more detailed when compared to the style of
       the use cases in the EGA Reference Model. Therefore it would
       help flesh out what is needed in the context of OGSA. Doing UML
       would be good.
     - It was noted that EGA graphs (DAGS) are specific to
       instantiation
     - Tentative agreement on the HPC Profile proposal but need more
       information before making a decision.

   AI-0925e: Hiro to talk with Andrew Grimshaw and Mark Morgan and
             bring back a concrete proposal for the HPC Profile use
             case as a convergence candidate.
 
   - What are the deliverables?
     - If the use case approach works then the refinement could be put
       in the next version of Reference Model.
   - Should this work be in the same WG? Should a new OGF Reference
     Model WG be formed?
     - Forming a new WG is a possibility, especially since the
       reference model work is at a different level from other OGSA
       work
     - Initially this work can start in an OGSA design team. It could
       be spun out later when the scope is clearer. A decision could
       be made by the end of the year.

   - Does this mean that the result is a converged model? 
     - Yes, the result would be a reference model that also covers the
       HPC space, in addition to the enterprise space.

   - Can we expect more use cases from EGR-RG? 
     - Maybe but their use cases are more abstract

   - Paul Strong may bring more use cases

   - Part 2 of the Reference Model document includes use cases. Should
     these be in a separate document? Or should the work be done in a
     different WG?
     - Doing the use case work in the same WG is ok
     - Typically the use case document would be a separate document
   
   - Another open issue is how does the Information Model work (in
     context of DMTF) comes together with the EGA reference model
     (dags).
     - A possible viewpoint is that the EGA Reference Model is the
       overarching model: 
       - With specific/concrete stuff mapping to CIM
       - But some more abstract stuff do not map to CIM easily
     - There is some more abstract work in the SMIS space and this
       will end up at some point in DMTF schema
     - So the DMTF might be an eventual consumer for some of this work

   AI-0925f: Hiro to talk with Ellen Stokes and add more items in DMTF
            register in the context of this convergence work

   AI-0925g: Tom will send a note to the list (to: Ellen S and Fred M)
             on why the current separation of service/info model may
             not be quite right.
