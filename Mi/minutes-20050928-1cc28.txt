* Minutes of September 26 approved with no changes.

* OGSA AuthZ discussion

** Specifications

  OGSA-AuthZ-WG has changed the names of both its specs following
  Hiro's comments about the usage of 'OGSA'. (And also changed
  'Profile' to 'Specification' since the documents do not conform to
  the OGSA Profile Definition.)  Hiro, however, had intended the
  comment to apply only to one of the two documents (the Service
  document) that is using OGSI for the rendering---the Attributes
  document does not and could have kept OGSA in the title.

  The AuthZ WG's intention is to update these documents later (next
  version) and use the 'OGSA' term. But they could also just be
  resubmitted to the editor. (Perhaps the WG was over-zealous in
  changing these documents).

  Agreed to discuss these issues further at GGF15 in one of the OGSA
  AuthZ sessions.

  - Some detailed comments:
    - eduPerson is defined and seems to be required for all
      services. But the document is actually just defining vocabulary
      and it is up to each service whether and which attributes it
      will use.
    - 'edu-' prefix: As defined by Shibboleth and names kept as is.
      'eduPerson' is originally intended for Higher Education. Here
      pulled out some of the more generic attributes but did not
      change the names.

  - Hiro has more comments on the Attribute document but these will be
    discussed on the mailing list or GGF15.

** Charter
   
   - Deliverables: 
     
     It is not clear if the WG will deliver one document or two. Also
     a requirements document was mentioned on the call but it is not
     listed in the charter.

    - There is also the possibility of one more document on
      blacklist/whitelist service interaction.
    - Hiro also wants a document on fine-grained delegation of rights
      since it is functionality relating/required by a number of OGSA
      services, e.g., Data has recently raised a set of requirements.
      - This field is a political minefield since there is no standard
        'policy' language. SAML/XACML address some but not all issues.
      - It is also difficult to get people to use something like this
        just because a standards body says so.

  The charter will be discussed at GGF15. There is also a plan for a
  discussion with the Data WG.

* Basic security profile review

  Takuya uploaded a new version before the call.

  There was an action to ask other parties (Industry, Projects) on
  their requirements wrt TLS and MLS.

  Hiro talked to people within Fujitsu and also people involved in
  outside Grid projects. Overall the opinion is that TLS is a more
  basic requirement than MLS. 
  - MLS is seen as application specific. For example, which part of
    the payload to sign or encrypt depends on the application. It is
    not enough to say sign and encrypt everything. 
  - MLS is more complex and the requirements for including MLS in this
    profile have not been made clear.
  - The key exchange portion of the profile is one feature that may be
    useful to both TLS and MLS and should be kept.

  Proposed and accepted to focus the secure channel profile on just
  TLS in the interests of making quick progress. Leave MLS out until
  the requirements for it are made clear. MLS may be included in a
  later version; or a separate profile for it may be defined.

  Action: Takuya and Frank to re-check the WS-I BSP for the MLS
          choices and which portions of those might be refined in an
          OGSA security profile.

  There was also a discussion on how to communicate the set of
  security features that an endpoint supports and how to negotiate
  which of these features to use in an interaction.  The negotiation
  process is not specific to security but there is a need to
  characterize the set of security features that can be
  negotiated. (At the moment the Profiles provide 'Claim URIs' which
  indicate an all or nothing claim and do not make clear which
  optional features in the Profile are supported.)

* CDDLM demo

  Demo by Ayla Dantas.
  Slides were sent to the list before the call.
  URL used for the demo: http://150.165.85.155:8080/muse/services

  - OurGrid introduction.

    This implementation is part of the OurGrid project. The CDDLM
    implementation is built on the Apache MUSE project. It is an
    independent implementation done using the CDDLM specifications
    only. There will also be a demo at GGF15 in a CDDLM session.

  - In the Architecture diagram: What is resource manager? A web
    service that has operations to create context (tomcat context that
    can create a CDDLM system) on the resource. It is not a Resource
    Manager in the OGSA sense.  Probably it should be renamed to
    something else, e.g., component manager.

  - Description of CDL, including a number of features such as
    extends, lazy, etc.

  - Demo went through entire CDDLM lifecycle.

* GGF15 & F2F meeting

  - Proposed and agreed to have one more presentation in the Overview
    session
    - A presentation on an alternate basic profile. It is a
      continuation of the BoF held in the last GGF.
    - Allocate 20 minutes: A person from UVa (Marty's team, probably
      Glenn) will give the presentation.
    - Also planning to have an ad-hoc BOF during GGF15. (UVa and
      Microsoft)
