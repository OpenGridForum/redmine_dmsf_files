* DMTF feedback on Container Model document

  Ellen gave an update on the socialization process she has been doing
  in DMTF for the Container/Service Modeling document.
  
  She presented and discussed the document at the DMTF technical
  strategy committee, where it was received reasonably well---though
  there was no deep technical discussion. The document was then
  assigned to the Core WG. At this WG, however, it was not possible to
  make any headway. Not so much for technical reasons but rather due
  to the WG not wishing to accept other organizations doing work that
  changes the CIM core. They were not willing to look at the technical
  aspects of this proposal.

  Ellen has since talked with Jeff Hilland (DMTF VP of Technology) and
  was advised to put in a change request (CR) to drive it forward in a
  more formal manner.
  - The deadline for getting this CR in is the end of the week
    (ballots are every Friday; CRs must be in by the Monday before).
  - For the CR to make it in the next release of CIM it has to be
    approved by June 15.
  - If this CR does not go through then the OGF document should still
    be submitted to the OGF Editor for public comment. It can be a
    vendor/organization extension.
  - If the CR doesn't go through it might be worth waiting for the
    GLUE work to catch up before re-submitting. It was agreed to wait
    and see---until it is known whether the CR will go through or not.

  AI-0524a: Ellen will write and submit a change request to DMTF by
            the end of the week.

  The overall experience has not been good. The process was lengthy
  and slow and there has been a lot of resistance, which is at odds
  with the formal Alliance statements and work registers.  Ellen
  therefore proposed writing a letter to the people in charge of
  Alliances describing this experience. The group discussed whether
  this letter should be from 
  - an individual
  - on behalf of OGSA-WG
  - on behalf of OGF 

  It was agreed that this letter should be on behalf of OGF since
  Ellen is the AD for Management and was acting on the formal alliance
  between OGF and DMTF. Such a letter would have to be approved by the
  GFSG.

  AI-0524b: Ellen will draft a letter to DMTF by the OGF Standards
            call scheduled for next week

  There is a DMTF board meeting at the beginning of June (6-7), at
  Austin. 

  AI-0524c: Ellen will contact the IBM DMTF Board member and schedule
            a slot for this discussion

* Other business

  Hiro and Andreas are in the process of changing the way the agendas
  are built. The main idea is to simplify and expose agenda building
  by keeping agendas-in-progress directly in the OGSA (google)
  calendar. One side-effect is that agenda announcements will also be
  sent by the Calendar and will go to the list as html-formatted
  emails.

  More explanation will be given on the next logistics call.

  There is no call on Monday. The next call is on Thursday.
