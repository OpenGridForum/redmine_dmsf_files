* Action Item Review

**  AI-0409b: Liberty spec statements on EPRs (compatibility or
             intent vs OGSA BSP) should be checked; are these true and
             is there some difference in interpretation that is
             unresolvable? - Duane will do an initial review to be
             discussed on the April 23 teleconference

-- Duane concludes that the language and policies are not
   inconsistent, but not wire compatible.  Liberty is not only an EPR
   provider, but also authentication service.  We have not profiled
   such an implementation, but observe that the schemas are different
   and will require different parsing.  At this level, they are not
   compatible as different implementations of a standard might be, but
   are not incompatible in concept.  There is no equivalent to some
   Liberty ideas in terms of use of identity as a client in what we
   have profiled so far.  There is also a difference in semantics that
   Duane regards as a deficiency in that security mechanisms used to
   transport the message-level content are limited to single strings
   in Liberty EPRs. The different URI components referenced are not as
   flexible as the Secure Addressing profile.

   Andrew refers to a mesage sent out March 20 by Duane (he will
   refresh this reference with a new e-mail shortly) and proposes
   closing this action item.  This was agreed.  Note the discussion
   can be moved to the tracker item on this topic.

* Use case document and profile review

  Andrew noted comments made by by Alan regarding discoverability and
  service requirement description features and indicated that these
  are or will be addressed in the OGSA Security Profile 2.0 - Secure
  Addressing document.  He displayed this document, which is on the
  repository, on Glance for discussion.  This covers usage of EPRs
  that are descriptive, and allow the client to know what it needs to
  do to talk to a given service.  The heart of the document is in he
  definition of hte security context in section 4.  The security
  contacts go into the metadata piece in the EPR.  An example is given
  in the document (see XML beginning with
  "<secaddr:SecurityContext>...").  The example given in the document
  describes a service that expects transport-level X.509, as is common
  practice now, followed by message-leel security for some portion of
  the transaction.  In this particular case, it also says how you
  would expect to authenticate.  The "contexts" allow you to define
  items that can be described in later profiles.
  
  From a process point of view, Andrew wanted to address a few
  comments received so far at this point.  The trackers are the ones
  in GridForge in the OGSA-WG by Hiro for these items (see
  forge.gridforge.org and navigate to OGSA-WG then Trackers to get
  there).  Under "Addressing" there are a couple of specific items
  that need to be dealt with at this point:
  
** A comment was made by Hiro that WS-SecurityPolicy has a mechanism
   for describing how to do such descriptions, but not where. Andrew
   responded that this has been slow to converge, and is more general
   than what we are trying to accomplish here.  Progress is being made
   on that front (i.e., SecurityPolicy) and Duane has been studying
   the draft spec, but the intent here is more specific and aimed to
   be quicker.  We may have to redraft the OGSA work once the
   WS-SecurityPolicy work is complete, but it is not clear yet how or
   when.  The syntax of the schemas are likely to be different once
   the OASIS work is complete.  (See www.oasis-open.org for further
   details on this progress -- look for the ws-wx TC public
   documents.)  Andrew proposes an action item to look into this in
   detail and see if an early recast of our work can be made based on
   the current status of Ws-SecurityPolicy.  Alan noted from the
   Glance session that an use case examples document has recently been
   posted in WS-SX (May
   15) that may be useful.

** Another comment was made by Hiro that use of a MUST ought to appear
   in the profile documents for security contexts, i.e. "A provider
   MUST support one of the following..."  No one seems to own this
   comment, which had come up in the face-to-face meeting.  Some
   discussion with Frank followed, in which the necessity to avoid an
   empty security context was pointed out.  Andrew was concerned that
   any specific limitation will necessarily lose some portion or other
   of the community, and he, Alan and Frank agreed that what is
   necessary is for a given community to specify its accepted set of
   authentication mechanisms and be able to discover, advertise and
   select inclusion of services based on conformance with their
   desired set.  Section 4.4 of the Secure Addressing document fives
   an example of such use.

** Comments were made at this point that the Secure Addressing profile
   becomes more of a meta-profile when viewed in this context.

   Interoperability is then expected to be provided in the derived
   profiles for particular security authentication mechanisms (TLS,
   X.509, etc.).  Frank pointed out that this introduces another
   layer, and in this sense is not a true profile in and of itself in
   the sense that it could ensure ineroperability, but Duane and
   Andrew and Alan felt that the existence of this layer is in fact
   essential for ultimate interoperability.  After discussion, this
   was agreed to and the comment was closed as "resolved."

   - Would this make the OGSA BSP and SP secure channel obsolete?
     Andrew believes that it will, once complete.  Both intend to put
     key information into the EPR.  The combination of Secure
     Addressing and specification of the transport (by the Secure
     Transport document) will eventually supply a key set that will
     supersede BSP and secure channel for the reason that the BSP core
     does not provide all of the features described here.

   The comment was closed with notations made by Andrew to this
   effect.

* Next call in this series will be on June 18 (Monday) 6 pm Eastern.
