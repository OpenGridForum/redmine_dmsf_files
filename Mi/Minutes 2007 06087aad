1) Early discussion:
 
* Roll call 

Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
Allen Luniewski, IBM (Note Taker)

2) Roadmap to Public Comment
Mario and I discussed the items that need to be addressed to get the Data Architecture document into public comment.  We agreed to the following:
	1. Choose a language (US vs UK English) for the document and fix spelling/grammar to match.  We agreed
		on US English.
	2. Chapter 2 needs work.  It is a collection of disjoint sections.  The purpose of the chapter is unclear.
		We must ensure that all material is where it belongs in this chapter.
	3. Verify that chapter 3 is still consistent with what OGSA is doing these days
	4. The comments about policy and data service in 3.7 do not belong in this chapter since they are not
		OGSA comments but OGSA Data comments.  They probably  belong in a new chapter 2 section.
	5. We need to rationalize headers in the operation tables that are at the start of chapters
	6. Chapter 9, Cache, needs to address operations on the data in the cache.  e.g., how does an
		application get at the data in the cache?
	7. Chapter 12 needs an operation table at its front
	8. We need to update Appendix 13, Standards
	9. Chapter 14, Operations, needs to be created once the operations in the document are stable
	10. Chapter 15, Operation Mapping, needs to be created once the operations in the document are stable
	11. The Glossary needs to be finished and validated
	12. The references need to be finished
	13. Need to check comments in the document and either address or move to trackers with an agreement that
		they are V1 issues.
	14. We need to review current tracker artifacts and either address them in this version of the document
		or agree to defer them to V2.

ACTION: Please review the above list and correct/add to it as appropriate either in teleconferences or via mail to the mailing list.

Mario was given the write token on the architecture document.
