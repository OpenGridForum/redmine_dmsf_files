* Summary of new actions

   AI-1009a: Review slide 6 again and clarify what the problem is
             (Reference Model Design Team)

   AI-1009b: Review the Reference Model 'Manage Job' in more
             detail. Specifically look at it from the perspective of
             an enterprise application (e.g., a 3-tier app) (Reference
             Model Design Team)

   AI-1009c: Hiro to ask Jay to provide his comments for Slide 6
             - Perspective of submitter vs platform provider and the
               hierarchical model connection

   AI-1009d: Jem will produce a topic discussion list for the
             converged glossary


* October 5th minutes accepted with minor corrections
  - Correct Abdeslem Djaoui's name
  - Add Andreas Savva to participants
  - Correct AI misnumbering

* Oct 2 minutes approval postponed
  - Many people were not aware that the Oct.2 minutes had already been
    posted.

* EGA Reference Model 

** HPC Cluster Use Case

   Explained by Hiro

  - [slide 2] Note that this description is more general than the
    scope of the *HPC Profile*---this is an HPC cluster use case
  - [slide 4] The "Abstract Application Definition" appears twice in
    the stack 
    - There is no problem doing this from the view of the EGA
      reference model. (It is not necessary to have a 1-to-1 mapping
      of things on the stack.)
    - In this case the "HPC cluster" level is probably better called
      "virtualized platform". Agreed to make this correction. 
  - [slide 5] Provisioning, etc, are noted as out-of-scope of the HPC
    use case. They do happen but they are done (typically manually) at
    very rare occasions---e.g., at installation or upgrading of
    environment---and might occur a long time before or after the
    actual HPC use case of submitting a job.
    - There is no actual model conflict here but that is perhaps due
      to the HPC work not focusing on these aspects even though there
      are a number of assumptions. (And the assumptions should be made
      explicit.)
    - One consequence of this analysis might be to start looking at
      some other use cases; and so leverage other work from the
      Reference Model. Staying only on the HPC use case might provide
      enough coverage.
    - The works otherwise seem complementary
    - "Managed Job" in the case of the EGA reference model is probably
      a much richer concept than in the HPC use case
      - A longer lived application vs one-off invocation
      - Interactive vs non-interactive; but this may be less true for
        HPC applications nowadays
      - If one can thinks in terms of aggregation of HPC jobs as
        higher level services then it would fit better into the EGA
        model
  - [slide 6] Raises the issue of difference in job vs application
    state model
    - Reviewed Paul's suggested alternate figure sent to the mailing
      list. Agreed it is a good way of looking at things:
      workload - job +- hpc cluster - node
                     +- binary
    - This relationship occurs frequently. It is the same for
      database/database service/database software. (An instance of a
      database service is composed through managing the things it
      depends on.)
    - There is a danger here of trying to do a very elaborate model
      (like CIM). It is important to know where to draw the line and
      stop.
    - OGSA position so far is close to "stop once the service is
      identified"; the Reference Model on the other hand takes a few
      more steps towards CIM; but aims to have a broad rather than
      than a deep view
    - There is no assertion by the Reference Model that there is only
      one possible graph
    - Another difference is what the submitter of the job cares about
      (needed characteristics/attributes) vs what the
      environment/platform provider cares about (which includes the
      hierarchical model needed to instantiate things)
      - (With the reference model it is enough to focus on the current
        node; no need to try and dig deep in the hierarchy.)
    - Some preliminary work is being done in OGSA in the context of
      the EMS scenarios---the JSDL and CDL connection.
    - There is a need to discuss and refine the next version of this
      figure; and incorporate Jay's comments

   - [slide 5] Need more discussion on what "Submit Job" means
     - Also "Manage Job" in the Reference Model is much richer than
       what the HPC/BES model are doing
       - This is essentially the difference between (discrete)
         invocations of an HPC job and taking care of an enterprise
         application that once up has to be taken care of, resources
         provided appropriately to maintain the required service
         level, etc.

   AI-1009a: Review slide 6 again and clarify what the problem is
             (Reference Model Design Team)

   AI-1009b: Review the Reference Model 'Manage Job' in more
             detail. Specifically look at it from the perspective of
             an enterprise application (e.g., a 3-tier app) (Reference
             Model Design Team)

   AI-1009c: Hiro to ask Jay to provide his comments for Slide 6
             - Perspective of submitter vs platform provider and the
               hierarchical model connection

** Glossary review

   Jem has produced an initial draft with EGA terms highlighted.

   Agreed that the target is a converged glossary by GGF19. (The HPC
   discussion is higher priority.)

   It is important to know where there are differences or discussion
   points. Agreed that the discussion should proceed by email and the
   occasional time slot on a teleconference.

   AI-1009d: Jem will produce a topic discussion list for the
             converged glossary

* AI Review

  AI-0928c: Closed. Obsolete since we have agreed to provide normative
            text
  AI-0925b: Closed. Draft was posted to gridforge
  AI-0921b: Closed. Started writing charter.
  AI-0921d: Closed.

  AI-0803e and AI-0803f: No update. 
           - Hiro volunteered to talk to the CDDLM-WG.

* OGSa Roadmap Review

  Chris Jordan gave an overview of current state, followed by some
  discussion on the status of various documents.

  - There have been many contributed updates, in particular from Jem,
    Hiro and Andreas.
  - Still missing updates for some documents, especially HPC Profile
    and Naming.
  - With respect to the state of documents Dave S mentioned that the
    status of the WSRF and WSN specs has changed since the publication
    of Roadmap 1.0.
    - For the Roadmap however the various specification owners (that
      actually refer to WSRF or WSN) have to update their documents
      for the Roadmap tables to change.
    - Chris J is leaving the update of the tables for last.
  - Status of HPC documents
    - The HPC Use Cases have finished their public comment period on
      Sep.20.
    - Not sure about the HPC Profile
  - Naming documents: Not sure. The profile does seem close to
    completion.
  - Review progress at the next Roadmap call

* Other business

  - Jem has updated the OGSA Wikipedia entry to bring it up to date
    with the publication of OGSA 1.5 and Basic Profile 1.0

  - Thursday's call is cancelled
