* Experiences Document
	- Changes for Globus tools didn't end up inside.
	- Not another profile interop test
	- Genesis II to try interop with Globus endpoint next week.
	- Agreed to reuse simple type from simple dialect expression from WS-Topic
	  and will introduce a new element of that type in the WSRF-BP
* Profile Document
	- Vivian to make 6.1.2 more clear, but content is fine.
	- Vivian need to import WS-Topic schema into profile schema.
	- Vivian needs to update final Excel spreadsheet (Hiro will help).
	- Vivian replace TM in title.
	- Simple dialect also pops up in WS-BaseNotification...should we mention
	  that document.  We probably should.
	- Better to refer to Roadmap 1.1 rather than 1.0.
* Do we need another call?
	- Probably not -- we just need to do the updates that we talked about.
	- Next call on 17th of July, but we'll cancel in the likely case that we
	  don't need it.
