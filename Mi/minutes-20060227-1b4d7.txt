  Hiro sent out a proposed agenda for the April F2F.

  Confirmed again that Information model and EMS (including CDDLM
  discussions) are the main topics.
  - CDDLM joint discussion is on the list. Dejan may not be able to
    participate if the meeting is in the UK but there are other CDDLM
    people based in the UK.

  OGSA-HPC: Marvin has said that he cannot make the week of April 3rd
    in person. Hiro is contacting Marvin to check if he can lead by
    phone, or whether someone else (Marty) can lead in person.

  Information services: no person leading this work within OGSA-WG
    at the moment. (It is also identified as a 'hole' in the MS
    paper.)

  Security: Frank has a clash for both the weeks of April 3rd and
    April 10th. Takuya can lead the session and is talking with Frank
    on work items.

  The location and dates are still unconfirmed. Agreed to a survey and
  to check the results at the next Monday call.
