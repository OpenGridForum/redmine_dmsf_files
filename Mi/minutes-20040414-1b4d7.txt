* OGSA glossary

  - Terms to be discussed "Grid" and "Virtual Organization"

    - Grid
      - Proposed definition taken from OGSA document
      - (Dave) A grid definition should cover at least
        1. Distributed
        2. Across administrative domains

        - The proposed definition covers 1 but not 2.

      - Jay's proposal: 
        - "...integration, ... services and resources across
          heterogeneous environments .... collection of resources and
          users virtual organization ... across administrative and
          organizational domains (RO)"

        - Key points are to include terms such as resource, VO,
          administration, etc.
          
    - VO
      - Two definitions in OGSA document. 
      - Merging them together still does not seem to cover all the
        nuances. Second definition is an operational one.

      - Decided to keep text in first definition and merge the first
        1-2 sentences from the second definition.

      - Maybe contrast with RO? In that case make sure that the Grid
        definition also mentions RO.
                
    Action: Jem to update definitions and post again
    Action: Jem to post new terms for discussion next
            week. ("context?")

* Provisioning capability discussion

  - Background
    - Provisioning definition as a cyclic activity (control loop) was
      discussed and rejected last week
    - Control loop is a more generic pattern. Pull it out of
      provisioning and rename (in this case) as "Service Level
      Attainement Loop"
    - Redefine provisioning as a straight line activity instead
    - Provisioning is one response to changing conditions; there are
      other. 

  - Rather than revising last week's document produced new one to try
    and nail down the terms

  - Discussion focused on two points
    - Inclusion of "scheduling" step in provisioning activity
    - Provisioning as a recursive process (build things)

  - One major objection to current definition is inclusion of
    "scheduling" within provisioning (Jay)
   - Contrasted job execution scheduling to scheduling within
     provisioning
   - Scheduling from a provisioned pool vs getting things ready from
     an unconfigured pool (to provisioned) for use by the scheduler.

   - Some definitions/proposals put forward
     - scheduling: plan, choreograph, execute
                   might be hierarchical 
     - provisioning: changing configuration of resources making
                     them available to scheduler
     - So a scheduler fault (no resources) might trigger a
       provisioning activity to make resources available.
       - There were two different next steps discussed
         - Provisioning would be given the resources to make ready and
           put in scheduler pool. So it would just carry out actions on
           specified resources. If it fails some higher level activity
           would have to be invoked to get more resources.
         - The provisioning activity would be told what to prepare. If
           no resources are available then it would request them from
           some other entity (scheduler?). But the scheduling activity
           itself is not inside provisioning.

   - (Jay) Would like to make separation between scheduling and
     provisioning clearer/wider
     - One question with this document is whether the "scheduling step"
       means that scheduling is inside provisioning.
       - Perhaps not a scheduling action but 'something' that is the
         result of a scheduling action?

   Proposal is to move scheduling out of provisioning. Define
   provisioning as just getting things ready. (Provisioner just
   carries out actions on specified resources.)

   - And avoid/minimize problems with recursive process in the
     current proposal.
     - Don't provision service; provision resources. It implies some
       recursion.
       - Might incur scheduling to get sufficient resources.
       - And recursiveness across scheduling and provisioning

   - Side discussion on relation between workload management,
     provisioning, scheduling.
     - Don't want to define strict hierarchy between these
       activities. They are interrelated. E.g.,
       - scheduler creates agreement (top)
       - workload manager (closer to resource level) tries to attain them
       - scheduler, provisioner can break them (to maintain other
         agreements)
       - So provisioner may also have to reason about agreements

   Action: Jay to provide use-case-like scenarios to clarify
           relationship of provisioning/scheduling/workload mgmt by
           Monday and continue discussion on Wednesday from 8am JST
           (second hour of call) onwards.  Work out details with Hiro
           (via IM).
