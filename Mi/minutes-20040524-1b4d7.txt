* Early Discussion
  
** May 5 Minutes correction - no comments, approved
** May 17 Minutes - no comments, approved
** May 19 Minutes - no comments, approved

* GGF11 Update

  - All session changes have been reflected on the online GGF11
    schedule. (Some detailed information may be missing from the last
    session). Hiro will followup.
  
  - Fred proposed switching the DMTF UC-WG cross WG meeting on June 8
    with the Data design team session on June 9. (In order to combine
    the two cross WG sessions: UC-WG and WSDM-TC.)
    - The proposal was rejected because the Data design team session
      would then clash with the Grid File System WG session.

* Information Services (IS) review
  
  - Draft posted to list:
  http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/ogsa-wg/2004/05/msg00076.html

  - Reviewed by section

** Objective
   
   - "Uniform view & query language"
     - Not sure what is being proposed here
     - It is more of a discovery requirement
     - Might be better to reword or move further down

   - "Each OGSA system" 
     - The term "system" gives a somewhat implementation feel to the
       text
     - Replace system with 'service' 
     - (Not clear if 'service' is right either)
   
   - Bill and Hiro have a number of other minor comments

   Action: Bill and Hiro to mark up document and send back to Abdeslem
   Action: Abdeslem to produce a new draft addressing the points
           raised in the review.

** Models

   - Producer/Consumer
     - Discovery is part of IS, and there are different types of
       discovery, but the text here should not be focused on Discovery
     - "If the consumers know in advance..." 
       - Problem determination logging UC: Might know the producer but
         would not access directly.
       - 'producer' is used in a general sense, could be the
         intermediary (e.g., logging system)
       - Reword to make this point clearer
       - (There is more slant on Discovery in this section)
     - Discovery provides minimal information; post-discovery returns
       more copious information. Are both of these scenatios covered
       by the same mechanisms?
     - Ravi raised a Broadcast example: discovery is not an initial
       step
       - Still would need to discover broadcast group
       - No, might be pre-configured and in some promiscuous mode
       - Not interested in the producer just the information stream
       - Proposed that the text should cover 2 more cases
         1. passive case (not going out to seek/discover things)
         2. pre-configured 
         - But are the interfaces different or not?  Do not want to
           end up assuming lots of 'things' that can not be described.
         - Do we dissallow these cases?
           - Something like 'sniffing packets' is out of scope. Only
             when it comes to publishing that information does it come
             in scope of the Information services.

       - A P2P scenario is at the bottom of the broadcast scenario
         used by Ravi. 
         - Proposal to make clear that there is no centralised
           information directory.
         - The text does not assume a centralised directory and P2P is
           mentioned later on 
         - Might be better to make statements more declarative
         - And de-emphasize the discovery need (mention as option)
           - This is what the text should say and if it does not it
             should be fixed.
         - And do not have to go to the producer to get the
           information

  - Data Model/Query languages
    - "XML model should be supported" : 
      - Some discussion on whether OGSA is prescriptive on XML or not
      - Prescriptive in that the 'envelope' must be XML but not
        necessarily the data (that is the intent of the text; might
        not be clearly expressed)

  - Metadata model
    - Why are events called out in particular here?
    - Some conflict between title and the explanation 
      - The text is much more specifically about events
    - Event definition here is different from the Glossary definition
      - In this text it is "metadata associated with information" that
        may be closer to "message" instead
    - "metadata ...describing structure"
      - Metadata may also describe properties, usage, etc

    - Bill proposed to make the metadata section disappear by merging
      it other sections of the document

    - Metadata is data; depending on usage it may be just data or
      metadata
      - The text should be structured differently to make it clearer.
    - Also need a glossary definition

    - Ravi gave a 'blob of data' scenario to describe metadata
      - Data and association
      - Might have 
        - Tight binding: metadata as one with data
        - Looser binding: e.g., through some kind of association
          service
      - Proposal to add this kind of discussion here was rejected. (It
        seems out of scope.)
      - WSRF connection: Use similar mechanism to model?

    - The structure and title names used here is the one decided at
      the F2F.

    - In conclusion it looks more like a change in title to something
      like "Event schema" might be more appropriate rather than
      addressing Metadata issues in detail.
      
** Example scenarios

   - Directory
     - UDDI example might not be appropriate. It is a concrete example
       that people can understand but it is not specifically grid.
     - Other examples of directories: DDNS, LDAP, MS Active direcotyr,
       yellow pages ...
       - But all these are legacy.
       - Need to be careful how these are presented; and describe the
         motivation for something new in a better way.

     - Inband/Outband discussion
       - UDDI updates are done out of band (same as DNS)
       - Might want to add a dynamic example (GMA is added for this
         reason)
         - But GMA example is too broad/specialized
     - "...static information"
       - Proposal to remove this phrase. It is not essential to
         Directory explanation.
       - Static/dynamic has two meanings here:
         - Data (changing data or not: low or high rate of change)
         - Entry (add/remove data)
       - Might want to tease the meaning of this out some more:
         (- Scenario driving directory is different than GMA directory
          - Consumer-side doesn't seem to be different
          - Internally it is different
          - Historical perspective: Using LDAP required knowing the
            types of queries in advance
            - Could build monitoring system using it but it would be
              somewhat limited.)

   - Message brokering
     - WS-notification reference should be added here

   - This section should go into use case like scenarios, e.g.,
     problem determination, monitoring, etc.
     - So the level seems to be different than what is expected.

   - Logging
     - Bill to add text

   - GMA Monitoring example
    - "OGSA information/monitoring"
     - Are the services in this section doing monitoring or are they
       information services?
       - Abdeslem thinks that there is no difference between
         monitoring and information (except a timestamp on the
         monitoring data, i.e., some extra information and/or
         semantics)
       - (Ravi) Semantics are added when information is consumed
       - Is the information system also a monitoring system (or is
         that behaviour something added)?
         - (Abdeslem) It is also a monitoring system
         - Might need to rewrite this scenario to show that
           information services can also be used to do monitoring and
           that this section is about monitoring
       
** Producer/consumer patterns

   - Agreed to remove DBMS from Fig. 1
   Action: Bill to produce a new Fig. 1

** Functional Capabilities

  - Text is making distinction between service and resource
    discovery. It might cause problems/confusion so the two sections
    should be merged.

  - "Monitoring tools"
    - Seems a bit out of place
    - How infomration is used but not part of the services
    - Agreed to remove it

  - Need to show what are the functional capabilities
    - Rather than "Distributed logging" need the functions that can
      enable it.
    
  - Bill repeated his position that he does not think that everything
    can be lumped together into a super-general producer/consumer
    interface. (It can in the abstract but not when coming down to a
    concrete interface definition.)

  - Mediation query planning
    - What is the concrete interface? plan_query vs query
    - But are these interfaces really different? eg. is format
      different?
    - Also how about multiple query mechanisms, or types of queries?
      With reference to OGSI (and probably WSRF), there was a "find
      service data" but the the door was left open to add other query
      methods/formats.
    - Query and interface seem to be in scope but the query planning
      part seems to be somewhat out of scope.
    - Proposal for Query 
      - Some basic types supported
      - And mechanism to find what is supported
      - Extensibility (to add more)
      - And check whether we already have all this courtesy of WSRF.

** Interactions with OGSA

  - Is there some minimal set that can be assumed or do we call
    everything out in each section (e.g. WSRF, Agreement, etc)
  - There is an infrastructure section in the OGSA document. Perhaps
    everything that is listed there can be assumed by default (but may
    not be used by all services in all capabilities).

  - Agreed that the "Interactions with OGSA" section should talk about
    higher level (not infrastructure) services

** Other discussion

  - What does "Capability" mean?
    - Ravi's definition is that "Capability is interface, semantics
      and behaviour"
    - (Hiro added that Capability in the OGSA Capability section
      encompasses more than one service; a 'function' supported by a
      number of (interacting) services.)

  Action: Jem to add definition of Capability in the glossary.
