Minutes of the CGS-WG Telecon 4/27/04

Participants:
	Susan Malaika, IBM US
	Brian Collins, IBM UK
	Larry Flon, USC/ISI

Strategically, we agreed that for Hawaii we should have a draft UML diagram for integrating database logical schema info into CIM.  We discussed what we have to start from, including ANSI/ISO SQL, the DAIS Spec, etc.  There does not appear to be any current UML for this.

Susan will determine what the best place to start is, and we will take a cut at a UML diagram for next week's call.
