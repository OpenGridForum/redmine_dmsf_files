OGSA Teleconference - 17 December 2007 - Roadmap
================================================

* Participants

  Dona Dickison
  Andrew Grimshaw
  Chris Jordan 
  Andreas Savva

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* Approved Dec.10 minutes with no changes
* Two document issues remaining from last review
  - Update security profile sections and tables (Hiro)
  - Wording changes suggested for HPCP from public comment (Chris)

* Document review

  Confirmed that both sets of changes have been done. Replies have
  been posted to the public comment forum.

  Minor issues noted during review:
  - Some tables seem to be bigger than others. Check the formatting of
    the referenced specifications table before submission. (Chris J)
  - In the HPC Profile section change the name of the WG from
    OGSA-HPCP-WG to HPCP-WG to reflect the recent name change. Also
    the Table caption needs update. (Chris J)

  Once these changes are made the document should be ready to submit
  for publication. Chris will confirm with Hiro that a final call has
  been done.

* Next version

  This document is scheduled for periodic updates. One issue has been
  how to make the editing more collaborative and how to provide up to
  date public access to the information. These issues should be
  revisited for the next version.
