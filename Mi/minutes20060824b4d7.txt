Base Fault Discussion
---------------------------------
	* High level points from Microsoft
		-- Assume a certain naming convention which the tools for Microsoft don't generate by default
		-- Exposes security risks because of nested hierarchy
		-- Industry is pushing contracts and whether or not it is met by someone.
	* Consensus is that we just define everything in terms of SoapFaults and we'll develop internally an InfoSet for it.
		-- Action Item:  Tom to write this up.

Activity as a vector or as a singleton
----------------------------------------------------
	* Reading through the minutes from the profile working group, wsan't clear whether or not the HPC profile group was asking for a restriction on the BES interface or not.
	* If BES remains as a vector with a degenerate case of one, the is that still OK?
		-- Seems fine
	* Consensus, BES doesn't need to change

Latest Draft Changes
-------------------------------
	* Marvin going through v22
		-- Moved Appendix A into introduction
		-- Whosale change on state model
		-- Refactored the two port types with the attributes
	* Will need to add faults from Marvin's state change stuff to XSD and WSDL
	* Will need to change appendices to match new attribute model
	* Make the model 5 states, not 3 with 2 failure states.
	* Action Item:  Marvin to continue with the pen and try and cleanup document (including possibly looking into the appendices)
