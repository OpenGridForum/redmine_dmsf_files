* Agenda Bashing
* Version 34 (change tracked version from public comment).
	- Extreme Happiness envelopes the attendees
* Unresolved issues
	- Generation of unique BES Activity Identifier
		-- Being generated by the client, not by the service
		-- May need to put some words of clarification in about what we will do with this identifier.
		-- Consensus is that this is already well described in the text.  Vote to not change it.
	- JSDL Elements not being able to support complex processor architectures
		-- Valid issue, but it's a JSDL issue, not a BES issue.
		-- At beginning of attributes, put in sentence saying that this is interm model until information model comes around.
	- Representation of Queues within the BES container
		-- A BES endpoint in front of cluster with a queue.  How could a user say that he wanted a job submitted into a long 
		   running job queue rather than a short running queue.  Stephen to write text
	- TotalNumberOfActiviites -- what about failed/finished.  The text in 6.1.4 is clear, we just need to make the table clearer.
	- Author List
		-- Add Mark Morgan to author list
		-- Add Yang Zahn (sp?) to acknowledgements.
		-- Combine acknowledgements with contributors
			-- Dave Snelling
			-- Ellen Stokes
			-- Jay Unger
			-- HPCP working group
* A decision was made by the group that typographical comments and comments about resolutions to public comments will be accepted, 
  but that comments which *SHOULD* have been made earlier in the process (public comment, etc.) MUST be postponed for future 
  extensions and future work.  This last comment period is only about public comments and typographic errors.
