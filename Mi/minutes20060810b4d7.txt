Agenda
-----------
	* Assign a notetaker (Mark to do it)
	* Modify the agenda to insert quick document status review
	* Attributes and Attribute Model
	  	-- Try to come to closure on what the attributes are going to be.
	* Do we want to talk about Base Faults?
		-- Not here -- do on email
	
* Status Review
	* Ian took the pen on the document and now we can't get ahold of him
		-- Time constraints are starting to approach for the HPC profile.
		-- Andrew to be a little more agressive working through Argon to get ahold of him and then Andrew will take the pen back.
	* Confirmed with Dave Snelling just before this call that the State Model representation decision at the F2F (The Marvin Plan) that he had come over to that side.
* Info model and attributes
	* The types are in-precise (that should be precise such as xsd:integer)
	* Flat vs. Hierarchical
		-- May need to go flat for now and go to something else later.
		-- We're going to need to settle for flat but write into the document that future versions may change the cardinality or other aspects of this.
		-- There is a consensus that the specialization things such as posix or the WSRF attributes do NOT belong in the base specification, but they do make a lot of sense in extensions and in particular a POSIX extension in the appendix of this document.
		-- If I have a schema for these attributes, then we can make the multiplicity correct for a more hierarchical system.
		-- We're going to go with Andrew's suggestion of
			Container Attributes
			Vector of resource specific attributes (such as OS, num processors, etc.)
			Make sure that the resource document MAY be a BES document, but doesn't have to be.
	* Attributes
		Common Name should be a MAY (BES Level)
		LocalResourceManagerType MUST be a QName (both a BES one, and inside the resource document).
		TotalNumberOfActivities (Mandatory at the top level, but optional at the bottom level)

*** Discussion ***
Are we talking about:
	BR = Base Resource
	BES = <
		Whatever for the BES itself
		Array of BR | BES

	* So, instead, we will label things as BES or BR
Define BR as BES minus the web service specific things.

Need more pictures.
		-- Total number of activities is BES only
		-- Activity Reference is BES only
		-- Description (BES)
		-- Execution Service Location (remove)
		-- Job Credential Service and File Credential Service should be removed -- no one knows what they are and they seem specific to certain implementations.
		-- Proposal to nuke (OperatingSystemVersion as it is included in jsdl:OperatingSystem)
		-- OperatingSystem is a BR thing
		-- MaxProcessesPerUser -- what is this?  Belongs in an extension?  Yes, consensus on this
		-- CPUArchitecture is BR
		-- CPUCount is BR
		-- CPUSpeed is BR
		-- PhysicalMemory is BR
		-- VirtualMemory is BR
		-- Writeable File Space -- consensus is to take out.
		-- Network Bandwidth -- consensus is to take out.
		-- Library -- a VERY good extension, but doesn't belong here.  Belongs with deployment, but not here.
