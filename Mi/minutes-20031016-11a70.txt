* GGF9

** Minutes approval

  - GGF9 minutes (pdfs) uploaded to gridforge can't be read due to
    included asian fonts (again...)
  - Acrobat asian font pack can be used to work around this
    problem. Works on Linux too.
    Ref: http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html

  - Action: Redo pdf conversion >Andreas
  - Agreed: Postpone minutes approval since people couldn't read them.

  - For the last session (platform) only have Fred's minutes.
  - Action: Ravi to send his minutes for the last session (platform)
            to Andreas

** Overall impression of OGSA sessions

  - Overall agreement that the sessions were successful. They were
    informational not just for the OGSA-WG but also for the other
    participating groups. (Making them aware of each other's work.)
    Some overlap became obvious; it should help our factorization
    work.
  - This was our first try so by necessity we couldn't go too deep. It
    was a good starting point but we should focus on more detailed
    agenda next time.

  - Agreed: It is important to keep the conversation going with the
            other groups.

  - Comment: If we really manage this process well the branding comes
             automatically.

** Branding      
   
   - OGSA branding was discussed in GFSC. GFSC was sympathetic, but
     there was concern about OGSA-WG taking on too much
     {responsibility, namespace}.

   - (People can say they are using OGSA freely; It is more difficult
     to talk about compliance.)

   - Agreed: Be vigilant about people using the term 'OGSA' and talk
             to them if we think they do not use the term correctly.

   - Agreed: Write up how we expect people to relate to OGSA (and push
             to GFSC too).

   - Action: Ravi to do first draft of this document.

     Comment: Ravi seemed to have a more technical perspective (define
              plugpoints) but one example classification that came up
              was:

     1. part of ogsa 
     2. compliance with ogsa
     3. building on ogsi (but not necessarily ogsa): ogsi-compliant

     Agreed that we can't just let people say "OGSA like" unless we
     can define what "OGSA like" means in concrete terms.

** Session summary

   Worked through half of the one line summary sent out before the
   teleconf by Andreas and added comments. Postponed the latter part
   since some people had to drop out early.

*** Data session

**** DAIS - Alignment with OGSA doc

     Globus+IBM and DAIS worked things out prior to GGF. There was no
     obvious difference between what's in the OGSA document and the
     DAIS presentation.

     Comment: DAIS started from RDB but has grown to cover various
              data sources, e.g., XML and files, hence the overlap
              with GFS-WG --- see further down.

     Agreed: Keep watching.

**** OREP - Building on top of what DAIS was; a bit out of sync at the
     moment. Might take a bit to come round. 

     Because of their relation with DAIS we expect that they'll move
     over to current DAIS abstraction. (No action on our part.)

     Agreed: Keep watching.

**** PA - Not clear yet if OGSA data abstractions are what they
     need. (Waiting for more refinement.)

     - They don't claim to be OGSA at the moment.
     - They are well advanced; they have stuff working. It will take
       them a while to 'come round'.

     - Agreed: Let them finish and then look into possibility for an
               ogsi/ogsa re-factoring. In any case it doesn't affect
               us too deeply --- mainly implementation from our point
               of view.
   
**** GFS - Not clear that they want to build on top of DAIS. (SOA too
     complex for them at the moment?)

   - They seem to have narrower focus than desired (by us). Not well
     integrated with what's happening. (They want to support POSIX I/O
     APIs and (?) global name space services.)
   - Their 2nd BOF voted to make it a RG (23 for, 8 against) but that
     doesn't seem right. There are already products out in this space
     so it is not a new topic.

   - Agreed: Look at them again when/if they become a WG.

*** PE session

**** GRAAP - Building on top of OGSI. Alignment with OGSA doc.

     - Agreed: We have to watch this space. 

       In particular we need to really understand what agreement is,
       as it is creeping through the entire architecture. We should
       begin by highlighting all concepts of agreement that *we* are
       interested in and making sure abstractions are strong enough to
       be used throughout.

     - Comments: 
       - It looks like there are still many issues not addressed. Work
         is in initial stages; needs refinement.
       - DAIS using agreement. Not sure if they are also defining
         agreement terms for data.(?)

**** JSDL - Presentation not just on job submission description. Willing
     to explore OGSA role but also looking at other grid environments.

   - Presentation gave the impression that they are trying to tackle
     more than what their charter says. They are not. It is just job
     submission description.
   - GRAAP is strongly involved in the WG. DRMAA is also interested in
     it.
   - JSDL would also like to be used in non-ogsa/agreement settings.

   - Agreed: Keep watching.

** DRMAA - Interested in exploring role in OGSA.

   - There is no overlap between DRMAA & JSDL. Think of DRMAA as
     having defined a job template that can use jsdl inside.
   - So far the focus has been on legacy stuff. Finishing with C, java
     binding and may focus next on gwsdl (ogsi) binding.  

   - Agreed: They are not affecting the architecture but the
             implementation.
   - Agreed: Useful to continue a dialogue. 

   - Action: Andrew to look into bringing them into PE/Provisioning
             subgroup.

[Postponed discussion of remaining sessions for next call.]

* Plan and schedule 

** Telecon time slot in November and after (Day-light saving time will
   end soon.)  

   Resolved: Use the same timeslot [4:00pm CST], which means that
             Japan teleconf time becomes 7am and no change for other
             people.

** F2F meeting date/place

   Proposal: Do 2 F2Fs before GGF10. One in December and one in
             February.
   Proposal: Do both F2Fs in California. Andrew suggested
             SDSC as a possible venue, at least for one of them.

   Action: Hiro to send out spreadsheet and get people's preference
           for Dec&Feb.

   Comments:
        - Fred prefers week of Dec.8 (will already be in US)
        - Week of Dec.8th is exam period in US. Andrew can't travel.
        - Bill, Andrew prefer week of Dec.15.
        - Tail-end of week of Dec.8 may be a possibility.

** Documents review schedule

***  Missing texts

     Action: Review trackers and submit your text >ALL.
             And in particular Andrew for the Glossary section.

*** Jeff's comments

    Started going through these during GGF9 during a brief non-public
    session.

    - Agreed: Get Jeff on the call and continue working through them.

*** Other comments (Jem)

    - Jem posted some questions; mostly answered by Ravi.
    - Proposal: For wordsmithing stuff use Word's tracking feature to
                update and let next person with the pen
                accept/reject. (OGSI approach)

      Comment: Accepting changes leaves comments in so deeper issues
               can be carried in the document.

    - Action: Jem to finish up and send document to Hiro (or upload).

** Sub-group status

**** Program execution subgroup (Andrew)

     - Action: Andrew to send out minutes from GGF9 subgroup private
               session.

     - Proposal: Change subgroup name from PE to something else.

     - Andrew can't make next couple of PE phone calls as he will be
       travelling but can make the 4 calls after that.

     - Agreed: Cancel the next 2 PE teleconfs on the understanding
               that Andrew commits to driving the process forward in
               time for the Dec. F2F. 
     - Action: Andrew to draw up series of PE agendas(4) leading up to
               the Dec. F2F.

**** Logging system subgroup (Jim)

     - Teleconfs gave good feedback; ready to update document.
     - XML seems to be holding up.
     - Next step: Position logging wrt to ogsa fabric services
       (messaging, events, etc).

     - What to do with events? DAMED (defunct) used to do grid
       events. There are (at least) 2 specs in this area at the
       moment:

       - WS-Events (HP)
       - Common Base Events (IBM)

     - Rejected: Form event subgroup.

       We already have 3 teleconfs a week and it is getting difficult
       to get enough people on the calls.

     - Agreed: Keep the events discussion within the logging subgroup.

     - Action: Bill to send out annoucement and get more people
               involved in logging subgroup.

       Comment: Andrew would like to join the discussion on events but
       he won't be available next week.
