</head>
<body>
<h1>Minutes of the second CGS-WG telephone conference, Sept. 
24, 2002 </h1>
PG (9/25/2002)

<p>The Telephone Conference took place Sept 24, 2002, 11am - 12pm eastern time (5pm-6pm Central 
Europe Time)</p> 

<h2>1. Agenda</h2>
Following Agenda was agreed upon:
<ol>
<li>See who is there
<li>Agenda bashing (anything else to talk about today? anything we shouldn't talk about today?) 
<li>Comments to the minutes of last telephone conference
<li>Discussion of the new charter proposal
<li>future telephone conferences
<ul>
<li> every other week?
<li> enhanced by white board facilities?
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>2. Results of the discussions</h2>

<h3>Ad 1. See who is there</h3>

Following people joined the conference:
<menu>
<li>Andreas Maier, IBM
<li>Larry Flon, ISI
<li>Peter Gietz, DAASI International
<li>Tom Roney, NCSA
<li>Victor Mihajlovsky, IBM
</menu>

<h3>Ad 2: Agenda bashing</h3>

<p>no changes

<h3>Ad 3: Comments to the minutes of last telephone conference</h3>

<p>no comments

<h3>Ad 4: Charter</h3>

<p>It was agreed that the Term "Job Submission Interface" might not exactly say the right thing, since the group will 
not define an interface (sort of an API) but just an information model. Thus the term will be replaced by
"Job Submission Information Model" (JSIM).


<p>First document with the  CIM Class definitions of JSIM. A starting point for the discussions could be a document 
created by the IBM-NCSA activity. Victor will send a pointer to the list.

<p>Second document will describe mappings to LDAP and to XML. For the latter it will not just be a duplication of the 
CIMXML DtD of DMTF but should rather head towards OGSA requirements, which looks at things as service implementations.
Tom agreed to provide some language to clear these points
  

<p>The first bulletpoint under the may goals was discussed and it was decided to put it under the must list again and rephrase 
it to make it a kind of roadmap document for further enhancing CIM for Grid Computing. 
Again the document pointed to by Victor can help as starting point 

<h3>Ad 5: next telephone conferences</h3>

<p>It was decided to have regular calls every other week. Larry wanted to see if GGF phone call facilities could be used.


<h3>Summary of actions</h3>
Tom: produce some new wordings for the first two bullet points
Victor: send pointer to IBM-NCSA document
Larry: request info about phone conferences at GGF
Peter: reserve two timeslots for the groups meeting at GGF 6
