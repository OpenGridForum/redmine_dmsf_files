Minutes of the OGSA-D telcon, 13th July 2007


* Roll call

Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
Allen Luniewski, IBM
Dave Berry, NeSC (Note taker)


Mario was unable to progress his pass through the document last week but will do so over the weekend.   Allen will than review Mario's changes, accept the obvious ones and leave any controversial ones for the next telcon.

Dave progressed the glossary definitions with the OGSA WG.  He will revise the OGSA 1.5 document to bring it into line with the new data definitions.  When the OGSA Architecture document is in a stable state he will check the consistency of usage within the document. There is some discussion within the OGSA WG over how to synchronise the release of the new OGSA Glossary document.  

Dave will book a session for OGF21.



DONM:  Friday, July 20th.
