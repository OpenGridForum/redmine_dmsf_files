* Roadmap review

** Appendix B review

   - This section (especially the first figure) might confuse people
     since WSRF BP is not mandatory.
   - First figure should probably be substituted with a more generic
     one
     - Hiro suggested a figure inspired by "OGSA Capabilities"
     - Also CIM is in the figure and that might be confusing since
       there is no concrete OGSA statement on using it ('influenced'
       rather than 'based on')

   AI-0402a: Michael B and Hiro K will collaborate to draw a new
             figure one for Appendix B

   AI-0402b: Michael B to clean up usage of 'standard' and
             'specification' in Appendix B

   - Second figure is somewhat obsolete by now. There is also no new
     information to update it. In the past there was a plan to setup a
     data repository to track this kind of information but the idea
     never got off the ground. 
     - The figure itself may be controversial since there is no
       consensus on how to put the various specs in the various
       categories
     - Agreed to delete Appendix B Figure 2

   AI-0402c: Michael B to delete Figure 2 in Appendix B

** Other comments

   - Sec 5.2.2 - table is for the "secure channel" ; move to 5.3.2 and
     delete existing table which is (incorrectly) for the 'anonymous
     channel'

   AI-0402d: Chris J to add new table for 5.2.2 (Core)

   - Add "express authentication" profile as new. Posted new artifact
     and assigned to Hiro
   - Add "reconciliation of ogf and ega reference model".  Posted new
     artifact and assigned to Hiro

   - SCRM maintains a wiki with management-related specifications. It
     is mentioned in the text but there is no reference
