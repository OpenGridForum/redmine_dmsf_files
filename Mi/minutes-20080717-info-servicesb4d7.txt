Summary Actions
===============
SA: to send Andrew the documentation about mentioned service
AG: to prepare a strawman port type design


Minutes
=======

minutes approval: ok, no comments

discussing GLUE Use Cases:

- use cases defined in GLUE seem to be too broad
- SA: explains that they come from production scenarios and are 
currently supported in different Grid infrastructures
- HK: missing performance numbers about requirements

discussion moves to performance aspects:

- SA: I read from the minutes that 200 queries/s can be expected; 
this should be considered as a requirements for the entry-point in 
the information services;
IMO, it should not be expected as requirement for primary services 
such as a BES endpoint or SRM endpoint; what is the goal of this 
group? to define how info such as GLUE are exposed via primary 
services such as BES/SRM or to define how information is spread 
around via the information service?
- the latter

- SA: explains the hierarchical and LDAP-based structure of EGEE 
info service
- AG: we should not concentrate on the architecture of the info 
service (e.g., hierarchical vs. p2p); let's start by defining a 
simple port type that enables a client to query information stored 
in a server
- SA: we should avoid discussion on which data format/query language; 
suggest to have a generic port type where query language and data 
format are passed as parameters; people will implement what they 
want (even support for multiple formats); the port type should 
envision the possibility of inspecting the supported features;
- AG: and if a client requires an unsupported query language, a 
fault is returned; that's good, but what about interoperability? isn
't it better to define a different port type per query language/data 
format?
- SA: I prefer a single generic interface; (see flexibility of HTTP 
protocol); interoperability profiles can later be defined

- DF: how frequent data are updated?
- AG: in our work, we split static vs. dynamic

- DF: I'm a bit worried about large answers
- AG: we can provide iterators or ranges

- AG: we volunteer to provide a strawman port type definition to be 
used for discussion
- SA: I can provide a reference to a work performed by colleagues in 
Padova about generic query interface
