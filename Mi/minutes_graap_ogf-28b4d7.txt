Session #1
----------
- IPR
- General content, please refer to slides.
- WS-Agreement V1.0 'polishing'
 + All things which came up after submission of GFD.107 are typos and alike, except for one issue.
 + Errata document has been edited during the session and uploaded to GridForge.
 + (Action, Wolfgang/Philipp): Check trackers and close those solved. Check tracker #6325.
 + Slide 21, first issues: this is not an error, but a feature request.
 + Slide 21, second issue: agreement, that this is an error which has to be corrected. It might effect compatibility, although it is not quite clear whether in a way which would imply a new public comment period and therefore a new standard.
 + (Action, Dominic): Describe the error and the case around it to pass it to the GFSG.
- Advance reservation micro spec.
 + Status: 10 pages, more or less ready.
 + There was a request to capture reservations like "every day at 9 pm", but the group things that this is not necessary.
 + OASIS group tackles the problem much broader, but it may take some time before there is something to use.
 + Will become a Proposed Recommendation.
 + Next steps: Dominic will send the final draft to Wolfgang, who will send it to the GRAAP list. There will be a week for comments before the draft is sent to the OGF editor.
- Micro spec. for licenses will be discussed at OGF 29 again.


Session #2
----------
- IPR
- General content, please refer to slides.
- Results from last session presented.
- Presentation of WS-Agreement Negotiation draft
 + Clarification of relation between negotiation protocol and current WS-Agreement spec.
 + Discussion on use cases (not) covered. No decisions made re. what goes in to the spec. in terms of uses cases, but need for use case collection identified. --> Decision to put use cases into the annex.
 + Decision re. presented state diagram: Move "accepted" to "acceptable" state.
 + Q (Sebastian): Why do we need a state machine for the offer process? - A (Oliver): E.g. to jump back to a certain offer at some point in time. - (Sebastian): It has be made sure that the state between the parties is synchronized. - (Oliver) clarifies the state machine. The state transition has to be signaled.
 + Should the "Converging negotiation and constraint annotations" go into the negotiation spec or not? - (Sebastian) There are some generic assertions which make sense, like "this price or a higher one". Identified 5 to 6 constraint rules for this purpose. --> Oliver and Sebastian will discuss this offline.
 + WS-Agreement spec does intentionally not cover use cases like co-allocation. This is for other specifications or profiles to cover.
 

Session #3
----------
- IPR
- General content, please refer to slides.
- Continuation of negotiation discussion.
- Use cases for negotiation:
 + Advance reservation + co-allocation
 + Symmetric agent communication
 + Plain negotiation
 --> At least high-level descriptions plus sequence diagrams should go into the annex.
 --> Put at the end of the spec and refer to it in the beginning
- Converging negotiation and constraint annotations
 + Additional element in negotiation constraints and example in the annex based on Sebastian's suggestion
- Discussion about adding a "binding" element to the acceptable offer
 + (Ramin) Use case: "Negotiate without any binding with a number of providers, and at some point in time the user wants to say 'Now this is binding'".
 + Ongoing discussions ...
 + Potential Solution: Profile advance reservation directly for people who need it, but do not change the current spec. Suggestion (Oliver): Describe it in the state section. Suggestion (Dominic): Put an additional section into the Appendix. Decision: Add section to spec. to cover binding negotiations, describe one specific way to do AR.
- More on WS-Agreement Version 1.0 errata:
 + p. 30: TemplateId versus name: Remove "a specific version of" at the TemplateID description; Remove "having the same name attribute"
 + p. 16: Description TemplateId: Replace version with identifier.
