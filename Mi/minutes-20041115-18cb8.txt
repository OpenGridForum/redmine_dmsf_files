Feed back from SDOs:

1) GGF is very positive. The Steering Committee was ready to focus on more detailed aspects rather than the overall goals as they are currently outlined.

2) DMTF likewise is very supportive. In fact they want to know what more could be done. They would like to see how things could continue in the longer term, but with a sensitivity to organizations that wish to move more slowly.

3) We also had a general discussion of the current standards landscape wrt management.

Actions:

	- DMTF to take MoU and Business case to their board for further feed back.
	- Next Call - Due to the ow turnout, we will try to meet again next week,
		November 22, 2004, same time. Details to follow.
