* Review of BES Modeling document

  Document just came out of public comment; minor editorial issues
  only.

  Discussed usage of the registered trademark (R) symbol for OGSA. The
  suggested policy is to use it only on first use. Also agreed that it
  should be kept if it is part of a document title and that title is
  quoted in the text. (In contrast the Roadmap document sections are
  named in similar fashion to the document they describe but there is
  no need to include the (R) symbol there. It is a section not a
  document title in that case.)

  The OGF Editor has assigned a number to the modeling guide
  referenced by this document: GFD.118

  - l.64-67: Added text pointing to the Modeling Guide
  - l.436: Contributors as section heading, as in the OGF template
  
  Ellen will post the revised version and make a final call before
  re-submitting to the OGF Editor.
  
* OGF21 Agenda

  The plan is to run the Info Model session as a working
  session. Ellen will update the session agenda. The OGF21 print
  deadline is Sep.27.

  ACTION: Ellen will invite the GLUE-WG and RM-WG; and other
          interested parties to the OGF21 Info Model session
