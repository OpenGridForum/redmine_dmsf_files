- OGSA Interop discussion
    - Factory pattern: interop doc follows the notion of byte-io interop doc therefore has universal factory service for 
      WS-Resource
    - more specific info has to be provided from different implementations like endpoints,messages etc...
    - security issues are not covered at the moment or out of scope because Base Security Profile is on the verge of 
      version 2 from version 1
    - Change the diagram on Interop doc showing methods  in which ResourcePropertyChangeNotification is illustrated as       operation  rather then property
    - Consider SOAP body or main messages rather then SOAP headers   
    - Atleast 2 properties should be tested including ResourceUnknownFault and RPUnknownFault as base faults
    - Shiraz and Vivian refines interop document and implementation by the end of the next week
