Adoption discussion:

Slide up loaded to the website. Premise: There are enough spec to really do something. Consumer's need for standards is increasing. We need vendors to implement the specs. Pre requisites: Working production infrastructures AND user demand.

How to proceed: Identify trend setting customers (Possibility: Teragrid, EGEE, DESIA, NAREGI, NIH, E-Science community, NSA Cyberinfrastructure). Comercial: Pharma, Bio med, ? Identify trend setting vendors (Globus, EGEE, Unicore, MS, Platform. Altair, Sun, Sybase, Oracle, Amazon (EC2, S3)).

Developing new specs now is should not be our priority.

Possible Actions:
	- Contact EU Leadership to arm twist EGEE and Unicore
	- Contact Teragrid leadership to arm twist Globus
	- Contact NIH leadership to arm twist Globus
	- Contact E-Science community leadership to arm twist Globus and Condor
	- Contact TIT leadership to arm twist Globus and condor

Action : Contact these guys at OGF22.
	Kryiacos, Dane, Satoshi Matsuoka, Gentzsch, 
	Craig, Chris, Steve

Ideas:

	- Traverna port to BES
	- EGEE-LFN port to RNS, ByteIO (Needs Security) + BES and JSDL, GLUE
	- Unicore: RNS, ByteIO, GLUE
