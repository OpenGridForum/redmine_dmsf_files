* Review Comments: Secure Communication

   - Lines 152, 99, and 307 are just edits - will be done.
   - Cypher suites: Agree with the comment and will clarify the text
     and change the names of the policy documents to include the SSL.
   - AES_128 Issue: Preference for only one case in the document.

   ACTION: Duane to ask Blair if 256 is really a problem.

   Password AuthN Issues: 
      - Agree with the comment and make it a MUST use secure channel
        in Usn/Pwd case = Change to a MUST.
      - Allow both SSL and digested Pwds together = do nothing to the
        document.

   Sven's Comment: Certificate in the document Issue: The issue seems
   to be a corner case and it is up to the client to check the
   chain. The technology in this space is relatively mature and the
   area of the spec is not so central that legislating against poor
   implementation is necessary. No action on the document.

   Host name verification issue: Change the wording to "server
   identity verification".

   Typo will be fixed.

* Wrap-up

Docs to be sent to the editor as this was the last call. Only the
ASE_128 choice will be decided based on conversation with Blair. No
further review needed.

Need another call or F2F time for OGSA BSP 2.0.

AOB: None
