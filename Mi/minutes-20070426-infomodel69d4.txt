  -- 15 March 2007 (F2F): approved without changes
- Action item review
  -- no action items outstanding
- The group discusses the agenda for the OGF20 slot
  -- Ellen to update the session agenda on the WEiki, also for the 
     F2F slot
- The group reviews the Container/service model document
  -- Ellen received no comments the last week since calling for 
     comments on the OGSA ML
  -- Ellen hence started the usual DMTF socialisation process with 
     the document.
  -- Hiro asks about the change of the [ch. 5.1.1] Container's 
     former "IsOpen" attribute of type boolean into the attribute 
	 "ServiceCapabilities" or type bit map.
  -- Ellen explains that the type of "ServerCapabilities" is supposed
     to be an enum instead of a bit map.
  -- Hiro asks about the "int16" definition of the ServerCapabilities 
     later in the document (line 236 to 239)
  -- The group failed to grasp Ellens explanations in the light of
     the pending formal change of the ServerCapabilities attribute type.
	 The group decided to postpone this comment after the attribute's type
	 has been updated in the document.
  -- Line 445: Hiro asks for the correct copyright years
  -- Ellen immediately fixes the copyright years to "2006-2007".
  -- Ellen plans to put the document into OGF Public Comment phase 
     at the conclusion of OGF20.
