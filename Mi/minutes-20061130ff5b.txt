2) Info Model
=============
* XQuery presentation/live demo  [Notes for this section kindly taken by A. Savva]
    Explanation of xquery docs/jsdl/resource  - uses commercial version of saxon since it supports namespaces  - ( context is extremely important )  - ogsa-xq : evaluate an xquery in the context of an xml document    - uses saxon:evaluate-node   - question on scalability of approach since must produce an xml     document?     - this is just prototyping to see feasibility and what kind of       minimal set would be needed   - Enforce use of xquery processor?     - could do xquery in xquery as this example (but not require       specific xquery engine, don't have to use saxon)     - could parse and transform to a native query system(     - could query a db directly )   - minimal set; stated motivation to avoid DoS attack     - that's a bigger target than identifying the minimal feature set       that is expressible enough; sufficient expressibility for most       uses should be the target for the minimal set instead     - (...)   - xquery expression affected by the xml document structure that     will be searched   - xml encryption can be used in for example password fields; not     used here for simplicity   - Approach looks good; good to have a proof of concept     - Approach should be documented in the info model architecture       doc.       - AI-11.30a: Michel to talk with Tom and Ellen on how to go about it     - But cannot release code at the moment; need to check internally       whether and how it can be released 
  
  
3) Workflow discussion
======================
- Mark runs the group through the slides "Workflow thoughts" 
  provided by Andrew, Steve and Mark
- OGSA could either pick a specific Workflow language, and 
  alienate everybody else
- Alternatively, OGSA could pick none and create a new one, 
  and also alienate everybody else
- Orchestration and workflow must be separated
- OGF is best served with simplicity
- The proposal is as follows
  -- stay away from language and API specification
  -- Tightly scope WFDL (Workflow Definition Language)
  -- Ensure reasonable mappings from existing systems into WFDL
  -- Toos support
  -- Reuse as much existing as possible
- WFDL is XML based and describes directed graphs
- Nodes are WFDL, ord JSDL
- Nodes have labelled input and output
- Mark walks the group along a sample WFDL instance document
- Jay: This example is a dataflow graph, not a workflow graph
  -- Mark: Example 2 demonstrates other kinds of dependencies than
     data dependencies
- Jay: Dependencies should be expressed as resources produced and 
  resources consumed
- The group discusses Jays suggestion
- Jay points out that the Workflow effort should be very carefully 
  evaluated against the current other efforts related to JSDL
- Chris: Defining (yet another) WF language is probably a bad idea
  -- This would, among others, add delay
  -- Andrew: As pointed out on the slides earlier, picking a 
     particular WF language or creating one is a matter of "choose your poison".
  -- Fabio: We probably should focus first on listing the requirements the 
     languuage should meet
  -- Jay: I believe it is possible to combine this workflow effort with current 
          efforts for JSDL and Information modelling
- The group discusses possible further steps from here on
- Andrew: After this first initial investigation, does OGSA think that the WF 
  issue is important enough to set forth a design team now, or postpone for
  the moment
- Andrew proposes to set up a separate phone connference with a specific WF agenda
  -- Jav and Michel support the idea
- The group discusses the appointment for the next WF call
- Jay proposes to use OGSA's Gridforge wiki to collect people's requirements, 
  dependencies, favourite existing WF solutions, etc. together to get an overview
  on what's necessary and what's not.
  -- The group reaches rough consensus to picck up this idea

Any other Business
