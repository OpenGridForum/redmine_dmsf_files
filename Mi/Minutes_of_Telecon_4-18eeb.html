<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 3rd CGS-WG telecon was held this morning 
(8AM Pacific time). Attendees were:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Larry Flon (USC/ISI)<br>
  Viktor Mihajlovski (IBM Germany)<br>
  Tom Roney (NCSA)<br>
  Ellen Stokes (IBM)<br>
  Peter Gietz (DAASI)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>JSIM Document Progress Report</b><br>
  Ellen reported working on an updated draft.&nbsp; Currently reviewing the data 
  requirements of PBS, Tivoli Workload Scheduler, and Load Leveler.&nbsp; The 
  new draft will incorporate those items that match the needs of these current 
  generation job schedulers.&nbsp; This new draft will be circulated to the 
  email list well in advance of the next telecon.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>XML/LDIF Mapping Issue</b><br>
  Initial discussion re: polling the email list about whether to do these 
  mappings and when.&nbsp; However subsequent discussion led to the conclusion 
  that it is better to delay such a poll.&nbsp; Our primary task is to create 
  the MOF describing the JSIM that will be submitted to the DMTF.&nbsp; There 
  are no current tools that will auto-generate clean XML or LDIF from MOF.&nbsp; 
  All existing tools require user post-processing to produce something that 
  truly fits the target schema language.&nbsp; Since this is not something we 
  want to do more than once, it was deemed best to concentrate on the JSIM model 
  and the MOF.&nbsp; We can worry about what other forms we should deliver the 
  schema in once we are closer to that goal.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>What to do about Grid Jobs</b><br>
  Based upon a discussion that took place in the SCHED-WG mail list (see
  <a href="http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/sched-wg/msg00329.html">
  Grid Job</a>), Tom suggested that our WG consider how our work relates to the 
  concept of a client wishing to schedule a complex Grid Job that involves 
  coordinating activities on multiple nodes of a grid. A discussion followed, 
  and it was decided that we do not want to hold up our work on delivering a 
  practical CIM solution for today's job schedulers.&nbsp; However, we want to 
  be aware of the Grid Job work.&nbsp; For the moment, we will include in the 
  text of the JSIM document a Scope of Work section, that indicates our focus on 
  existing job schedulers such as PBS.&nbsp; We will also add a Use Cases 
  section to the document, and one of those should be the idea of a Grid Job 
  Scheduler using the JSIM model and local job schedulers for the individual 
  components of the overall job.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>How our work relates to Grid Services (OGSA)<br>
  </b>We did not have much time to finish discussing this topic before the call 
  ended.&nbsp; However it is unclear what role our group has in specifying 
  service definitions.&nbsp; CIM itself, through work that IBM is doing, will be 
  rendered as a Grid Service, allowing basic Get/Set Service Data operations.&nbsp; 
  We don't see yet that there is any specific Grid Service that this group 
  should model in relation to JSIM.&nbsp; But the discussion on this topic is 
  not yet finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next Telecon of the CGS-WG is scheduled for 8AM Pacific on Tuesday 
December 3, 2002.&nbsp; Dial-in information will be forthcoming.<br>
