* Security Profile issues review

  - Takuya uploaded issues: 7 issues in total for the secure channel
    profile

  - 1656: Added the WSRF BP Security Profile URI claim
          - Takuya to double-check that the correct URI is used
  - 1657: Takuya checking BSP 1.0 and will add the missing
          extensibility points, if appropriate
  - 1658: Focus profile on TLS and review MLS requirements
          - Main things left are statement to only use TLS (not SSL),
            mutual authentication, and some of the assertions.
          - The key exchange is worded for MLS but can also be used
            for TLS. 
            - Takuya to change the text to 'When exchanging keys...'
              instead of 'When using MLS...'
   - 1659: Takuya reviewing 
   - 1660: Agreed on the call that it is ok as is. 
   - 1661: Tom is ok as contributor
   - 1662: WS-I BSP reference. Takuya checking which version to use
           (Jan or Aug). But, unless there is a specific reason it is
           better to refer to the latest one.

   - Other issues:
     - Since there may be additional basic profiles the text
       describing the relation of this security profile and the WSRF
       BP should be revised. (Tom will propose new text.)
