Chris introduced the new roadmap editing team - Chris Jordan, Dona Dickinson, Mike Behrens, Patricia Kovatch, and Andrew Wang, with lots of help from Hiro. He gave a brief outline of the tasks each person will be performing, an overview of the process we're using, and mentioned the importance of trying to keep a large part of the e-mail discussions on the ogsa-wg mailing list, for the sake of openness.

We then moved on to a discussion of new documents that need to be added to the roadmap, such as the DMI work, the HPC Profile, and Information Modeling documents. Chris took the action item to follow up on getting the information modeling document information.

There was a long discussion of Gap Analysis - gap analysis is something Hiro suggested should be added to the next version of the document after the 1.0 release. Hiro suggested utilizing the heads of the 6 primary focus areas of OGSA effort to help in identifying gaps, and provided a nicely-edited version of Chris' "intentionally blank" slide including the focus areas and the responsible parties. Chris encouraged all OGSA members to mention gaps they identify, and to be responsive to us as we begin to request updated status information.

Finally, there was a discussion of the schedule for progress and final release of the Roadmap document, and it was agreed that at this point, we should be able to meet the proposed schedule. We also scheduled a couple of times for the OGSA group to have some discussion of the Roadmap document progress over the next couple of months.
