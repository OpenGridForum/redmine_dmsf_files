* Summary of Actions

  ACTION: BES-WG chairs to ask the data group to define the
          filesystems as their work product

* BES State Model
  
  - Rough agreement to extensible model: base (3) and extensions
    - ISSUE: unidirectional only; there is (at least) one system that
      can put running-pending. (The point here is the job id stays the
      same)
  
  - Substates: how to define
    - Two proposals
      - nested
        <a><b><c></c></b></a>
        - need to define nesting structure; 
        - is this more complicated when multiple people are writing
          the different substate refinements?
          - nesting defined as the way the 'profiles' are composed
          - profile-writer has to understand the relation of all
            profiles
      - parallel
        <a></a><b></b><c></c>
        - defined piecemeal; no global definition 
        - not fully parallel; (sub-)definitions in a single profile
          may have hierarchy
        - implementor will have to understand the relation of all
          profiles that will be implemented
    - (implementors will have to deal with different combinations in
      both cases)

    - PROPOSAL: known base states (pending, running, done), well known
      sub-states (hold, stage-in, stage-out, suspend,...); should be able
      to build the cross product of these states/sub-states
      - Do it for both approaches tomorrow to help make a choice

* Trackers
  [Trackers updated on- line; informational notes only]

  - 1821: fixed in document; closed
  - Added new tracker for "specification of container properties"
    - review all definitions
  - [artf5486] 
    - '..' behaviour is jsdl or bes issue or both?
      - Not a jsdl spec issue; bes spec has to state that it is
        undefined
    - ROOT filesystem: BES to state that write is undefined, read
      access expected but not guaranteed
    - Filesystem definitions
      - Need clearer definition of expected semantics of each
        filesystem (working, home, fast tmp, large). 
        - Agreed not possible by this group to do universal definition
        - Clearly state expected semantics but that there are no
          universally consistent semantics for the ones above in terms
          of sharing, consistency, persistency.

      ACTION: BES-WG chairs to ask the data group to define the
              filesystems as their work product

   - [artf5485] existing mechanism (defined operation) to get
     properties document which will include information on what is
     supported (closed)
   - [artf5512] keep RMF (closed)
   - [artf5517] resolved not document
   - [artf5483] open; depends when these interfaces can be ready
   - [artf5488] resolved;
