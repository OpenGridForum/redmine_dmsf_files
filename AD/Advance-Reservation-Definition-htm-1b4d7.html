<h3>Definition of Advance Reservation: </h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This definition has being discussed at some length on the mailing list. This reflects the current definition. 

<p>
<blockquote>
"An advance reservation is a possibly limited or restricted delegation of
a particular resource capability over a defined time interval, obtained by
the requester from the resource owner through a negotiation process." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Example resource capabilities: number of processors, amount of memory, disk space, software licences, network bandwidth, etc. 

<p>
It is worth noting that this definition is more detailed than the one used in the Grid Scheduling Dictionary (GFD-I.11): 

<p>
<blockquote>
"The process of requesting various resources for use at a later time."
