NLANR provides user services and this WG can leverage some effort<br>   from there, giving due credit to get information from the DAST/NLARN site.<br><br>2. CALREN has an applications chair who could provide more information<br>   and direction.<br><br>3. NYSERNet also has useful info.<br><br>At first these were all links, but now descriptions have been added.<br>NLANR provides user services.<br><br>To start the user services WG, we should build and augment the<br>Repository:  New information from<br><br>             -Exploration E-Grid<br>             -Send e-mail to all working groups. At<br>              the present time, expertise is now contained within one<br>              or two people who are super users.<br><br>Ginny has agreed to collect info as it comes in.<br><br>One starting point is looking over conference proceedings from HPDC<br>which has information about applications.  However, documentation is<br>a bit lacking for this.<br><br>The DCE effort focussed at the technical folks not the scientific<br>user.<br><br>The present scheme is unique as various grid environments coming<br>together for the first time. Levels of complexity is higher by an<br>order of maginitude.  Problems from someone else's administrative<br>domain, with several different systems for handling issues (such as<br>trouble tickets for instance).<br><br>This WG should take the lead and be an advocate for facilitating<br>policy discussion across organzations, take the users perspective and<br>become "user advocates* asking the tough questions.  One WG chair<br>Randy Bush recognized this important facet and asked "what do users<br>want from remote I/O" requesting a paper with requirements.<br><br>A good idea: what each WG requires from each other. As an example Lee<br>wants to see what users want from the Globus Group such as<br>documentation etc.<br><br>John and Rita: A white paper of requirements to would need to be developed.<br><br>Two organizations already going in this direction.<br><br>NPACI plans for computing systems and Alliance plans (NLARN)<br><br>Some of the issues to be addressed.<br><br>1.<br>2.
