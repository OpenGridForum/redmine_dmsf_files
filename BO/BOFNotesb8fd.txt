SLT= Be need to be able to describe the Terms.
Terms for BES/ ByteIO
WS-AG and JSDL may come into play.
Specify to factory like operations.
CreateActivity (JSDL, deadline, cost) Not parameters.
Dreatefile (ByteI/O )("Cost,size, ) read SLAs != Write Performance..
Specify Trade-offs esp. cost vs x.
Agree to terms.
Implement Service = Out of scope 
OGSA BES has taken out a long time. this is not in the scope 
Implementation definitely out of scope. 
Some of the deadline scope already exists such as Maui.

Should we start the OGSA design team?

Byte I/O Posix file IO like 
BES container JSDL based JOb service?

Reliablitiy Probaility that the system will operate 

Availability Confidentiality... (MTTF)/(MTTF+MTTR)
Dependability Document = misnomer timeslots/default section/operation name = foo 
    read dependability = 100% write operation could have less availability

Missing Tradeoffs.
Users are not willing for failure.. THe only question one could ask is 
How much are you willing to pay?(or Painfullness eg. Go to a site to complain)
Users' requirements are infinite. =>Abandone this approach. 
Adopt the MacDonalds Model Just give the users a finite no. of choices.
"Gold"=100 "Silver" = 80 "Bronze"= 30 (How do you define them?)
Powers of threes. (You may want to differentiate in space)
Gold in CPU Silever in Space..

OGSA BES is piece 
Specify
Deadline (BES is HPC Profile type)
 
Value function as function of time
Probaility it will completewithin the deadline
How much you are willing to pay
Confidentiality requirements exec  BES Resources are serially reusable resources.

**Can we use low quality resoures to realize High quality services
Is it time for OGSA to look into these issues?

Philipp WIeder : Do we want a gerneral purpose BES/ByteIO? seems too large
Mark MOrgan: Tie down to realistic usecases. 
Philipp: Do you have use case scenario? =>
Andrew/Marvin   For BES Yes.   **
             ByteIO/ could be very complex...
Zieschan from ** in Sweden: Yes, we need real usecases.
Start with the usecases. 
Who is willing to be in the design team? Many phone calls, resulting in 
Profiles, etc.
What it means to be in OGSA? 
     (Attend phone calls.)
We need to define Terms.
Essentially define schemas to 
DSL engines.
Someone: Have looked into WS-Policy? Ws-AG is also looking...

Toshi Nakata/Wolfgang: WS-AG can contribute when terms are defined.
Omer Rana: Paul Strong sent emails about service deployment terms. 
      What do you mean by defining terms? Really nail down what people mean by Availability by

Just do Byte/IO and BES

Volunteers: Zeeshan Shah zashah@kth.se PDC / Hugo Mills OMII-UK  / Mark MOrgan / Andrew
Yamin: Time is right for defining terms. WS-AG is trying to define common terms.
GSA is also looking into this.
WG or design team? Start as Design Team and if promising then go to the GFSG.

At least have two (BES Byte?IO so that we are not narrowed down too much.)
You can exploit something similar and also see what are not similar.

BES is almost complete. 

Should we have Design Teams => Yes.
One/Two specs? => Design Teams' Job to decide.
Volunteers are needed. 
If other teams are doing this, then should reach into other WGs.

Get a phone slot. Multiple Slots?

BES is much easier than ByteIO because ByteIO has more consistent.
Omer:It might be interesting to do a survey. 
     Lots of literature  out there.

Yamin: How do the design team work? OGSA ML itself doesn't seem to have 
enough context. Andrew: Can start a ML but prefer to have it reflected in OGSA ML so 
that people can monitor. We'll think of something..


Get the implementations out.

 
One or Two.
