<p>
Dave started the meeting by welcoming all and made some general announcements especially about the agenda of the meeting.
<p>
In the opening discussions, some views were put forth on whether the Apps Research Group (ARG) and LSG RG are complementary or in Conflict.
<p>
The meeting generally agreed that these two groups are complementary in nature. In particular Ed Seidel - chair of the APPS RG, encouraged everybody to create RG dedicated to the particular applications, and stressed that it is not in contrary to the APPS RG.   
<p>
Some of the pertinent points include:
<ol>
<li> The need for both groups to justify to GGF
<li> For LSG, there are natural reasons to exist e.g. the fact that biological data is distributed and the volume of data is expected to be very large, in the region of petabytes in the years to come.
</ol>

The meeting moved on to go through and approve the charter, goals and milestones (please see attached).
