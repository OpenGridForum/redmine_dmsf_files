<P>The Grid High-Performance Networking Research Group focuses on the 
relationship between network research and Grid application and infrastructure 
development. The objective of GHPNRG is to bridge the gap between the networking 
and grid research communities. It accomplishes its goal by serving as a forum 
for information exchange on advances and requirements in both fields, as well as 
by providing a focal point for liaison activities between the GGF and the 
various networking standards bodies. Specific topics of interest include, but 
are not limited to: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>End-to-end performance 
  <LI>High-performance transport protocols 
  <LI>Emerging network technologies 
  <LI>The interface between Grid applications and network services 
  <LI>Deployment of new technologies on the Internet and overlay networks 
</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The GHPNRG provides a forum for such topics until sufficient maturity and 
interest to both communities is reached that naturally results in the formation 
of a separate WG or RG to pursue them further. The discussions of GHPN are 
carried out both during the meetings and on the GHPN mailing list.</P>
<P>Two specific goals of the GHPNRG are identifying: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>grid application requirements and implementations that are not supported 
  or understood by the networking community and 
  <LI>advanced networking features that are not being utilized by grid 
  applications. </LI></UL>The natural forum for communicating the results of its 
work are through the periodic release of informational documents. The initial 
documents will concentrate on identifying gaps in understanding between the grid 
and networking communities. As GHPNRG identifies and explores topics, further 
informational documents will be written and released to the community.
