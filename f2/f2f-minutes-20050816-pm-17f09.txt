* EMS overview

  - Overview of EMS interactions by Andrew Grimshaw
  - From the point of view of EMS: 
    - Provisioning: "I want this application on this resource"
    - It does not cover provisioning hardware at this point.
    - CDDLM point of view is the same.

* CDDLM overview

  - A number of documents submitted
    - Foundation
    - Deployment API
    - XML based CDL
    - Smartfrog specification

  - Some approved, some in the GGF process
  - CDDLM builds on WSDM and provides compatible APIs

** CDL overview
  - Component Description
  - Property and property values for each component
  - Reference between values and extensions are supported by the
    language
  - Extension: like an abstract template that can be 'instantiated' by
    replacing values
  - Can provide references (values) to components after deployment
    (e.g., hostname)
  - Deployment API: prepare the resource
  - Content provider connection: e.g., ACS
  - Component provider: defines meta-data and wrappers for content
  - CDDLM can derive requirements from a JSDL document and decide
    which resources to deploy and then do so. And manage those
    resources.
  - In OGSA EMS: the resources are picked by CSG and EPS and only then
    does deployment start
    - (There is a need for an integration point between ACS and
      CSG. CSG would need to be able to get the application metadata
      in order to make an appropriate decision on where a particular
      job can execute.)
  - Job management in CDDLM figure is {JM and EPS}; terminology may
    not be exact as it is based on intermediate drafts.
  - Deployment API allows access to 'system', not directly to a
    specific component within the system.
  - Component: deploy and manage resources
  - System: just a collection of components (possibly made of multiple
    applications)
  - CDL: system needs to be defined to cause a deployment to occur by
    the Deployment API
  -  'System' in addition to deployment port also has an information
     port that can be used to access internal components. (e.g.,
     lookup via xpath.)
  - Lifecycle: 'running' means that the deployment is finished and the
    system is available for use.
  - The component model describes (effectively) the EMS container
  - Portal: well known; manages nodes and knows about deployed systems

  - Perceived overlap with EMS: CDDLM functionality seems quite close
    to BES functionality
    - EMS schedules and runs functional requests (e.g., run BLAST with
      parameters x,y...)
    - CDDLM deploys the capabilites that make it possible to run
      functional requests (e.g., install and make BLAST runnable on
      some node(s). It does not actually kick off a BLAST invocation
      with parameters x,y...)
    - The capability to be deployed might look similar to a functional
      request but it is with the intention of providing an
      infrastructure for other functionality. (E.g., deploy a hosting
      environment such as a web server in order to host an
      application.)
    - (Also discussed further down in 'Relationship with EMS')

  - Ping: only on system. It accesses each component's management
    interface for status. (A component by definition does not support
    ping.)

** Relation of CDDLM with SDD

   - Similarities, overlaps, missing pieces: not sure exactly what
     space SDD will cover.
   - CDDLM would like to keep deployment api
   - And perhaps some part of the CDL and Lifecycle model would move
     to SDD.

   - SDD TC is now doing use case analysis; might be worth to submit
     CDDLM use cases there
     - ACS has already submitted their use cases
     - And ACS will probably have some ability to include ACS specific
       content into SDD

** ACS introduction 

   https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/OGSA-2005-08-ACS/en/1

   - Each Application Description (AA) has an EPR
   - May have dependencies between archives
   - Large data may be outside and referred to
   - There is dependency support, but is it for same purpose as CDDLM?
     Can it store CDL? Same purpose.
   - Archive 'file' is similar to gar/jar/etc
   - If there are two applications are they in two archives or one?
     - Logically independent but could be in one archive
   - Can information about the deployment requirements of an
     application be retrieved? Yes
   - 'System' is a deployable entity (AA are the contents that would
     be deployed)
   - An Archive Description (AD) may have some similarities with CDL
     and ...
   - Other interactions: Replication, ByteIO as a transport etc
   - Does this model support partial instantiation (currying)? 
     - (Or making a copy of an AA and creating a new AA from it by
       extending it and overwriting some of the contents with perhaps
       different DD information which might have some particulars for
       a different organization. This would mean that the new AA would
       have a new EPR.)

** Relationship with EMS (integration)
   
   - It would be nice to use the same 'infrastructure' to deploy
     [capabilities] and to run those [capabilities]
   - Timing component might be a difference or the kind of resources
     being targeted might be different

   - Conditional (deployment): e.g., if there is an existing instance
     of, say, Oracle can one use it to deploy additional pieces to
     setup a new system?
     - CDDLM does no prohit it. But need to do some more work within
       CDDLM to achieve it: Check for existence of the required system
       and not deploy it. (It needs separate 'wrapper logic')
     - At the moment CDDLM does not allow definition of system of
       systems
   - System definitions are self-contained (do not allow definition
     that cross boundaries; but such connections can be done by
     'wrapper logic')
   - No concept of optionality in the definition
     - But CDDLM supports conditional workflow that can be used to
       achieve this (to some extent)
     - That kind of intelligent decisions are left to a higher
       level. CDDLM does provides some basic support for it.
   - CDDLM definition intended for provisioning resources that already
     exist and to re-use existing resources
     - Not for submitting functional requests
     - A provisioning request (action) is a kind of grid job
       (activity)
     - Hiro: The BG project also discussed this kind of recursion;
       decided to avoid it.
     - The CDDLM-WG also discussed this recursion or bootstrapping
       problem: scheduling talks to provisioning that talks to
       scheduling, and also tried to avoid it.

   - Agreed to define one or two scenarios and go through them to
     explore interactions between the various 'pieces'
     - Volunteers: Andrew, Jay, Ravi, Stuart, Mike
     - Goal to present something by GGF15. But need to produce
       something before that. 
   - Agreed to continue the work on the OGSA teleconferences.

   Action: OGSA-WG (Hiro,Andrew etc) to arrange scheduling such meetings in
           the future (Calls, GGF, etc)
