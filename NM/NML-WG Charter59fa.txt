Charter
=======
Abstract / Group Description
----------------------------
Hybrid networks  offer end users a mix of traditional connections and new optical services in the form of dedicated lightpaths. These must be requested in advance and are currently configured on demand by the operators. Because lightpaths are circuit switched, the user must be aware of the topology and of the techniques involved in the provisioning. Once connected, they offer a high-speed, low-level connection to the requested destination.
The working group will provide an extensible schema to describe computer networks. This schema should provide an abstraction layer for networks, specifically hybrid networks. Such a schema can be used to create inter-domain network graphs at various abstraction levels, to provide an information model for service discovery, and to facilitate lightpath provisioning.


Focus/Purpose
-------------
The purpose of the Network Mark-up Language Working Group is to combine efforts of multiple projects to describe network topologies, so that the outcome is a standardised network description ontology and schema, facilitating interoperability between different projects.

The groups and projects are: System and Network Engineering group of the University of Amsterdam, Network Management WG of the OGF, and GÃ‰ANT2 in particular, as well as efforts in the Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) community, Internet 2 and ESnet.


Scope
-----
The scope of the Network Markup Language Working Group is to define one or more schemas to describe:
 (a) a layer independent network topology and
 (b) properties that are common across for multiple network technologies, as well as
 (c) a mechanism so that other working groups or other projects may combine technology specific schemas with the schemas created by the NML working group.

The working group will not look into policy related schemas, nor into schemas related to scheduling and reservation.

The working group will use existing schemes as starting point, and aims to build as much as possible on work done in the IETF Netconf, CCAMP and IPPM working groups, if deemed applicable.

[ideas for additional text: "common language", "ontology", "schema" vs. "instantiate", "reporting topology", "descriptive vs. "prescriptive"."]

Goals
-----
The goals of the NML-WG may be defined by a set of deliverables and the milestones for their delivery. These deliverables are:


D1. An informational document describing the context of the work.
	[Should this document further refines the scope of the work? Freek thinks so.
	 For example, decide if we include dynamic information in the scheme (i.e. device configuration information) or just static information?
	 Decide if we include domain abstraction information in the schema or not? Decide to use UML, XML, RDF, and/or OWL (lite/dl/full) as the schema language?
	 Do we include example networks we want to describe in our network?
	 Should we describe the relation with other technologies?]

D2. A recommendation document describing a normative schema which allow the description of a basic network topology. This schema does not include any layer or technology specific information.
	[What we do is both create a model, that is we tell people how to map network elements to functional elements, and then give a syntax to describe the functional elements.
	 This implicitly also gives the scope of the schema: If you can't describe a network in these functional elements, you can't use our schema.]

D3. A recommendation document describing a normative schema which, along with the schema in deliverable 2, can be used to describe a multi-layer network.
	[Should we limit the scope here?
	 For example, we surely want to include a simple property which can be used to describe which interface/device operates at which layer, and we want a property that allows us to define the relations between different layers.
	 However, we don't want to create seven detailed schemes to define all details of ATM, SDH/SONET, DWDM, optical fibers, copper wires, IP, and Ethernet.]

D4. An informational document describing experiences and of early implementations.
	[Should we mention "interoperability test"?]
