- There are two very different views for information services.
  -- e-Science Grids (e.g. EGEE) are comsumer driven view.
  -- Data Center Grids are administrators driven view.
- Both has very different separate problems and we are not ready
  to discuss generic solution covers both.
- Laurence thinks information models for contents can solve 90%
  of problems.

- CONSENSUS: We table information services interface now and 
  may come back after contents model (GLUE 2.0 spec) is done.
