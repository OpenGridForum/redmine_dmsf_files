* Talking about BES QoX
	- Want to be able to apply SLA/QoS terms to "factory-like" operations
	- Need to specify tradeoffs
	- Implementation?

	* Common Terms
		- Deadlines
		- Compute Requirements
		- Value of the job
	* Occasional Terms
		- Penalty for failure
		- who "pays" for failure
		- Start time/duration
		- Probability it will complete
	* Is this a good set to start with?  Should we add any?
		- Compute Requirements are very much like JSDL resources
		- Deadlines stuff is info you need for scheduling
		- Start time/duration are closely coupled
			-- Start time vs. Start delay
			-- Total Run-time vs. Deadline
	* Physicists write custom code whereas Chemists tend to reuse the same program over and over again.
	* Another class of job is run job for as long as you can and give me the result at the end.
	* Add a new term
		- Response Time
	* RSS Group has some of these terms already defined.
	* Consensus to stay out of resource requirements
		- Leave it to someone else like JSDL
	* Next phone call is three weeks from today
	* Want to do a breadth first on these things for now.
