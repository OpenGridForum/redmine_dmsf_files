* Welcome and review of F2F agenda

** EMS breakdown proposal

  - Discussed proposal for a separate EMS track (2-3 people) to work
    on sequence diagrams.
  
  - Agreed to a short break out session in the afternoon to discuss
    what can be done: Andrew, Ravi, Darren, Steve M, etc
  - With the option for a longer breakout session on Tuesday

  [Note: In the end there was no parallel EMS session during this
  F2F.]

* BES-WG

** Overview of BES specification draft

   - EPRs are now a MUST and WS-Names are a SHOULD. The type used is
     the same (EPR).
   - The intention is for the WSRF rendering to be WSRF BP 1.0
     compliant. But it is not 100% yet.
   - Container is defined. Activity not defined. Influences what kind
     of operations are specified.

   - State diagrams is based on JSDL 1.0
     - Especially the stage-in/stage-out diagrams. But it is the BES
       decision to include those portions of JSDL in its
       specification.
       - Note that the staging state diagrams are not defined as
         sub-states. They are different state diagrams
     - Discussed and REJECTED: Modify the staging state diagram to
       simplify so that there are no separate
       staging-in/waiting/staging-out but a single staging state
       - Motivation is to keep a simpler (perceived) mapping to the
         JSDL spec 
       - It was also pointed out that the JSDL spec makes no statement
         on the state diagram for staging and that the authors did not
         intend a data staging state diagram as defined here.
       - People might still choose to comment during pc

   - Some states are optional. An activity does not need to (visibly)
     pass through them.
   - When an activity is suspended, the staging activites are also
     suspended.
   - What happens when a staging activity suspends?
     - The overall activity suspends, which in turn causes the rest of
       the activites to suspend. (Added clarification)
   - Suspend should be clarified further. Proposed text along the
     lines of "... stops the consumption of further resources, but
     does not necessarily release the resources."

   - start/stop container: Proposal to put them in a separate porttype
     to aid composition. (Rough consensus to do so.)

   - Added clarification: Events, if supported, are emitted per state
     transition. And even if the activity does not 'actually' go
     through a state an event should be triggered. E.g., if no data
     stage in occurs, an event is still emitted before going into
     execution.

   - Discussed rendering and notification types
     - Rendering: explicit that other renderings can be used
     - Notification: explicit 'not-supported' and also other types can
       be used.
       - Could a service support more than one? 

   - Discussed security considerations and how much to include in this
     document.
     - Proposal to add more detail on the issues (identity mapping,
       etc.) and state that they are out of scope. (Rough consensus)

*** Rendering
   - Fault definition: 
     - Proposal to do the definition as WSRF Base Faults, and then do
       a description for the WS-I rendering how they map to SOAP
       faults (used in ws-management).
     - An alternative is to do a new spec: OGSA Faults

     - Both REJECTED: Agreed to leave as is with parallel renderings
       from an 'abstract' description; and trying to make XML
       definition of {base faults, soap faults} as close to each other
       as possible

   - Resource advertisement: The WS-I rendering uses UDDI (mostly
     static information +'alpha' for the dynamic portion.)
  
*** Other issues
   - Resource discovery (resource information): It is out-of-scope of
     this specification. The choice of which BES Container to use is
     assumed to have already occurred. 
     - Another spec could provide the needed functionality.
   - Notification: It has been decided not to filter at the
     container. Filtering can be done further down.

*** Next steps

    Moving to a final call of the document on the list and
    teleconf. Then submit to the GGF Editor.

** Report on Interoperability meeting
  
  - Carried out at Imperial College between UVa (WSRF .NET
    implementation) and GridSAM (WS-I based)
    - Each project had its own test harness. Cross-checked test
      harnesses to test that both containers could run the tests of
      the other team.
    - Nothing specific to WSRF or WS-I rendering tested.
    - Tests worked first time (with the exception of a minor coding
      error)
    - Only correct functionality was tested. No error checking. Also
      no events.
    - It should be taken as a proof-of-concept, and working towards a
      formal interop. And towards an experience document.
  - Multi-grids interop to do both BES and JSDL and could lead to
    experience documents for both specs.
