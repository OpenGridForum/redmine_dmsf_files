- Dave Berry is giving a presentation on the progress in the OGSA-DATA group

- The group discussed issues arising from slide 6. [bad phone link makes it 
  very difficult to understand Dave.]

- Ravi is concerned about an overload of terms with respect to service and 
  resource [slide11]. Ravi revokes the question due to unfamiliarity with the
  OGSA Glossary

- Hiro: Storage management has a control interface - does it also also has a
  transfer interface?
  [Answer not understood because of bad phone line quality]

- Dave Berry clarified the relationships between storage and data:
  * Storage stores data, hence two interfaces exist, for storage and data, 
    respectively [slide 12]

- Ravi asks for clarification whether Federation and Cache are specialisations
  of Data Services
  Answer: Yes in the sense that the cache provides the same interface (among 
  	  others) as a normal data service. [slide 13]

- Ravi is concerned whether the Scenario 2/5 [slide 16] is actually a cache 
  scenario

- Hiro: [slide16] why is the Transfer Service not an Access Service?
  Answer Dave B.: The scenario implies that the user reads the contents of the
  	      	  file, so she rather transfers than accesses the file (even 
		  though access is an applicable term)

- Ravi, Andrew [slide 20]: These are actually not policies by themselves but 
  	       	      	   probably parameters to a policy, or QoS related 
			   terms in a SLA

- Andrew: [slide21] Is the ParentDataResource rather a ParentResource in terms 
  	  of derived data sources?
  * Naming should be changed to "SourceDataResource"
  * These terms are not exhaustive and not exclusive enough

- Andrew: [slide21] Shouldn't this be EPRs instead of URIs?
  * According to WS-Naming an abstract name is a URI

- Andrew: DataResourceAbstractName, is this what is in WS-Naming now called 
  EndpointIdentifier?
  * The DAI properties have been specified before the WS-Naming spec, so yes
    they are.
