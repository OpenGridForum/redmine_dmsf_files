* ByteIO session

  Mark showed a demo on a Windows box showed a streaming video that
  used ByteIO as the protocol to read from local storage.

  Neil showed a command line demo. It implements the simple transfer
  mechanism.

  Status of Specifications: Submitted to the GGF and currently during
         GFSG review. Expecting them to enter public comment in the
         near future.

  There are already a couple of implementations.

 Overview of the specification:

  - Writing at a location past the current end of a file has the same
    semantics as the equivalent POSIX one. (Add a statement to the
    specification.)

  - Defined URIs (enums) for the transfer mechanisms. Other groups
    might also want to use these. So is there need for a more general
    definition, not as part of this specification?
  - Also the URIs should refer to a specific version of the protocol
    but it is not defined at the moment which version that is.

* OGSA Data session

** Data Architecture review

Chapter 3: Architectural Context
================================

Are you going to treat storage as a separate thing?
- Get GSM to contribute this part

Dave S: DAIS doesn't have DBMS management in scope.  A lot of the OGSA
     stuff is starting to border on management, how does this parallel
     into the
Andrew: More similar to storage management.

Neil: some use cases available for database migration. Strategies for
      grid-wide management strategies but may also be similar to
      configuration and deployment and provisioning

Andrew: replication of databases

Hiro: Is database migration is a requirement? DBs are big and ...
  - Might be storing day by day updates and it is not too difficult to
    do
  - But do need real cases that require this functionality

Andrew: Design team on Information Services is not producing things,
        which is holding up other teams.

Takuya: What do you mean by Site and VO management?
- Dave B: mean the relationship between site management of resources
  and VO management of resources.
  - It is the interaction/usage of these and NOT VO management itself

Andreas: Do you have any specific requirements on EMS?
- Probably the dependency is the other way round
- Will require support for provisioning, e.g. database deployment
- Common reservation interface for different resources?
- Need more interaction with EMS to identify requirements 

- Transactions:
  - Could also think of them as a kind of session; need to look
    further

Fred M: When do you need info model for data services?
     CIM used for storage related stuff.

Mario: wanted to get a namespace decided so can import from CIM model
       - Potentially multiple entry points into the CIM model
       - XML realisation of CIM model.
       - Still working on all of this

Things to name
==============

Dave S: Naming: the other table you need is what you are going to do
with all these names once you've created them? Would be useful to
provide another document with this information - Stephen Davey?

Chapter 4: Security
===================

Dave S: have you looked at what happens to policies when something
happens to the data. In other words, what policy is applied to
derivative views of data.
  - For example, patient data may have looser policy if randomized
    (removing identifying info, etc)
  - It seems that a lot of the use cases have to do with medical
    applications and privacy

Andrew: but then it becomes a new data item

Takuya: Attribute based authorisation only focuses on service based
invocation. Dave is talking about another aspect of security.

Andrew: Not clear that XACML can cover all access control cases.

Dave S: where are the equivalent access control points in the the data
access pattern? is it the same as jobs? You have more dynamic
resources in data and it is often tied to the particular query.

Chapter 5 - Data Description
============================

Dave S: should give slides to David Martin and Malcolm Atkinson to
provide input to the roadmap.

Hiro: Why service description under data description?
- more for context than anything else
- not convinced it's needed

Ch 6 - Data Transfer
====================

Andrew: replicate a data container e.g. database, from one place to
another. Want a mechanism for copying the state of the service. A
useful porttype generally to be able to serialise state.

Dave S: this is much more low level, just looking at policies for
transfer mechanisms. But ability to serialise and migrate state is
another important thing.

Hiro: already separated access protocol (ByteIO) from transfer
protocol (GridFTP).

Very keen to ensure that DMIS work can be made generic in the future. 

Andrew: seems DMIS is at a different level from what you're requiring here.

Neil: agree, this is another access protocol and does not cover things
like choosing endpoints for transfer mechanisms.

Chapter 7 - Data Access
=======================

InfoD provides for third party delivery but is felt to be too complicated.

WS-Addressing supports third party delivery but it isn't normally
implemented. Could be the answer.

Mark M: ByteIO could be used for third party if someone was to profile
a new transfer mechanism for it, could split the control and data
channel.

Andrew: Seems heavyweight to select files from a file system. Could do
this as an application which brings together various existing /
proposed specs.  More like a profile than a new spec.

Still a requirement for wildcard naming. WS-Directory supports
this. Would there be a problem if the directory was dynamically
populated?

Ch 8 - Storage Resouce Management
=================================

? question missed

Hiro: GSM claims it's outside of OGSA

Ch 9 - Cache Services
=====================

Ch 10 - Data Replication
========================

OREP is dead.

Ch 11 - Data Federation
=======================

Argued over Data Federation definition and its relation/difference to
Data Integration.

Data federation is the integration of distributed data resources to
present a single coherent view.

(Some companies have proprietary versions and it seems like a hard
topic to standardize.)

Ch12 - Metadata catalogues
==========================

** Scenarios Document v0.8

(Note as we are using the document, rather than slides, I haven't been
able to put in locators for the questions and discussion)

Ravi: May want add Data Provenance scenario
- we don't cover this in Data Architecture just now.

Hiro: request that you update the reference the OGSA Use Case document
as this has been published

Hiro: is the metadata catalogue an instance of the registry as
displayed in the first diagram?

Ravi: you had data on the right, is it being modelled as a service or
as an object
- they're supposed to be data resources i.e. anything that can act as
  a source or sink of data

Ravi: can the discovery services, replication services be plural
- stephen: assumed many discovery services, single replication service
- allen: this is a simple ds1 to ds2 replication

[Figure on p9]
Ravi: why would the replication service be the one which publishes
into the discovery? the data service should do that. The authoritative
information source is the discovery service.
- Dave B: this is just one way of doing replication, not the only way.
- Ravi: problem with the semantics that go with the tags beside each line.

Fred B: How did you come up with the term discovery service
- a discovery service is not necessarily the same as a registry

Dave S: should split the roles of data manager and data accessor and
how they interact with replication and discovery services.

[p14]
Hiro: Visualisation service, you consider the rendering service as one
of the data services, not as a computational service using a data
service.  Ravi: separation of concerns is not clean.  - Dave B: it
produces data so it can be considered as a data resource.  - neil: can
have combinations of both compute and data porttypes/interfaces -
Ravi: make this clearer, show that this presents a view of the data
side of this scenario

Hiro: diagram is still not clear, distinction between services and resources.

Allen: wrap rendered animations as data services.

Dave S: might want to show the specific interfaces on each box.

[p19]
Fred B: Data Integration scenario, have difficulty with definition
of data discovery service.  Dave: our definition is a data registry.

Dave S: What's the difference between data integration and data federation.

Neil: it depends on who you talk to

Dave B: not sure whether it's always bringing all data to one place.

Stephen: schema mapping service stores the schema maps between local
and global schemas.

Ravi: schema mapping service in simple scenario suggests that the
service is doing the transformation
- Stephen: probably better to call it schema storage service or similar.

Hiro: why is it called Personal Data Profile
- Stephen: emphasise it is more than just a way of accessing data
  services but also a place to store all sorts of data you might need
  e.g. to configure your work environment.
- maybe use "personal data space" instead?

Dave B: Should we move data storage earlier in the document.

Hiro: why is "file space" box not got a grey background?
- Stephen: check back with Peter Kunszt, may to identify it's not a service.

Dave B: intention is that architecture document will refer back to the
scenarios document.

Hiro: do you have a plan to add a requirements section in the
scenarios document.

Dave B: Should make it clear what the purpose of the scenarios
document is at the start - it is not a use case and requirements
document.
- Stephen: it should already be there in the abstract

Next steps
==========

Dave S: can use must/should, not MUST/SHOULD since it is not a
normative document

- present/future distinction

Andreas: important to say that someone can do something in this way,
but that it's not actually a standard e.g. recommended.

JSDL spec shows a use of pseudo schema for types (copied from
W3C). Should ensure names, and arguments are well defined.

It is more important to pick the right names for the operations rather
than try to make sure that all parameters are correct. Going through
the process is important to clarify the architecture.

UML would be a good idea for normative specs.

Some discussion missed on requirements, ontologies etc.

As part of architecture, probably want to see what we want to do in
terms of gaps for working groups.  Persuade existing groups to do it?
Create new groups, do it yourself.
