* Information model

  (See Simple Info Model slides)

**  Consensus on Concrete model
  - Use p10 because of its support for Tooling
 
  Data Model
  - XSD
  - XML

  Information Model - document describing
     - Description/Semantics
(1)  - Architecture [Advertise / Request]
                      (XML)    (XQUERY)
       - Extensibility, and how it is derived from existing models,
         inclusion of existing XML models (e.g., CIM-XML)

  XQuery extension to JSDL 1.0 Resources description to be defined by
  the HPC profile WG as a proof of concept; and the symmetric
  relationships (p5) approach to be used as a base for next major
  versions of related specs (BES, JSDL)

** Work Plan
  
  Capabilities/Properties  -- Normative: Description, semantics,
                              types... XML/XSD

(2)  - BES Level (1.0)            
(5)  - JSD Level (2.0             
(3)    - interim 1.x for HPC Profile 
     - Consolidated level (Incorporate GIN/NAREGI/GLUE/CIM)
  
  HPC Profile to driver input to model
     - input to JSDL, BES
(4)  - do examples (ties to (2) & (3))

- Dependencies of above work:
