* OGSA and OGF Reference Model
==============================

Presentation (by Hiro Kishimoto)

** p6: Rendering using standards?
- Extend using UML
- Represent the set of objects more formally; not just 'depends'
  relationship but also 'interacts'; etc

- Tools for this constructing representation? some exist for parts or
  specific purposes; incomplete.

** p9-onwards: job state model
- Main difference whether one can tell which states have been through 
- Why a base+extensions and not a general+specialization
  - in certain cases the second might generate events that have no
    meaning
- (BES issues to be discussed in BES session)

** p15

General comment; overall, OGF models seem to have some more refined
states but do seem to be in broad agreement

** p17: skip (Tom Maguire is not present)

** p18: Need to look into existing work; a lot done by telcos etc

[In data centers] it is not so clear-cut nowadays since intergration
may be part of operations; the barrier is not as clear (as it used to
be)

** [skip glossary; Jem Treadwell is not present]

** p21: Should this be called OGF Reference Model? Decided to put off
   what to name the model as part of the document work; title changed
   to "Reconciling ..."

Dave Snelling volunteered to be co-editor for this document (in
addition to Hiro Kishimoto and Paul Strong)
