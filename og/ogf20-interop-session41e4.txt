OGSA Profiles Interoperability Testing
======================================

* Dave Snelling presentation

  - Can specs (e.g., OGSA Byte I/O, DMI) also be included?
    - Yes
  - Proposed a number of additions, including specs covered by HPC
    Profile
    - Byte IO has already some interoperability work; it is not the
      intention here to redo that work
  - But the purpose is to move the profiles forward; not a general
    interop event
   
** slide 4 

   - Include failure scenarios? The purpose is not to test
     implementations. It is to test the specification so this does not
     have to be covered. (OGSA-DAI example, and Byte IO)
   - Test all cyphersuites? It might end up being compliance testing
     which might be too much

   - Mutual authentication is mandatory but is not something that all
     implementations support or have use case for; and recap of the
     discussion around this issue. Agreed that this is not a technical
     issue but it is a show-stopper for those not supporting it.
     - Considered to drop SC Profile but this makes it difficult for
       others to setup their services.

** slide 6 - onwards
   - How to test WS-Naming; quick look through some proposals

** slide 10: WSRF BP
   - Value in testing this specific profile? Discussion without any
     resolution
   - Next step is unclear since there is no consensus on using all the
     OGSA Profiles
