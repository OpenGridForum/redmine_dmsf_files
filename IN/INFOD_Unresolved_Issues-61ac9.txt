This is a list of open issues. Each issue has a serial number, once it

2       What are components of the manifest section of the infod data (and metadata) message?

        this is the message that is sent to the consume or notifyupdate operations.
        
        Once that is described, scenarios like rgma can decide whether they can use that
        format to publish and essentially support the PO Box at the publisher site 

        A document has been circulated

5       Do we need consumptions as well as subscriptions?

7       How are registry object updates  broadcast to interested infod player

        for ex, how new subscriptions are found by publishers - 
        
        describe how notifying/finding appropriate consumers for
        metadata messages - specs don't do it now (notifyUpdate
        interface half spec'ed) and we didn't discuss at F2F
        (Animation scenario feedback)

        A dup issue: due to the dynamic nature of publications,
        publishers, etc., a subscription may need to include
        information about how to notify consumers of changes to the
        subscription dependencies (additional publishers, removal of
        publishers that occur over time, etc.).
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/03/msg00029.html

        What is the interaction between parameters of subscription -
        their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may
        interact with each other (what happens if data filter exists
        but not association, or if both exist, or none...) -
        Describing interaction will help readers understand these
        components better and simplify section 3 as at least one is
        required but not clear what non-provided parm means (means all
        as in '*' or means NULL...).

	These are the interactions between the INFOD registry and the
	INFOD objects:

          * The objects request modifications through the
            create/alter/dropINFODResource interface In response to
            such a request the INFOD registry will identify with
	    publishers are publishing or are able to publish the
	    requested information and limit the selection using any
	    criteria that is part of the publisher and consumer
	    specification.

	  * If the INFOD registry is unable to verify the expression
	    related to the data it will request verification by at
	    least one publisher using a web services interface.

          * If requested the subscriber will be notified - using the
            consumption interface - to select publishers and subscribers of
	    interest.

          * If requested the publisher will be notified - using the
	    consumption interface - about the changes:
	    new/changed/dropped subscriptions and new/changed/dropped
	    subscribers.

        Note:

	  * If the publisher (or subscriber) has not implemented the
	    consumption interface the information will be made
	    available using the POBOX. That is associated to an INFOD
	    registry.

8	How does registry handles EPRs, especially when logical EPRs for expressions?

        logicalEPRs don't current support expressions - define how to do so - indirection

15      Which (if any) components support transformations?

        Are they supported by consumptions?  consumption  has different  use-cases:
        replication,  fan-out with same subscription and different consumer
        transforms, different channel    options for a given consumer,

17      How do the propagation interface(s) differ from the consume
	interfaces and what is stored in the registry?

18      Should we be looking at other rule specifications and consolidate/align with them?

        E.g. This applies to transform definitions. Specs need to document approach taken.

        Also we are oriented towards putting things in multiple queues right now.  But the 
	consumer may not want to be able to see those queues, especially cross-VO. So we
        need a mechanism for replaying past events without the producer understanding the
        ID structure of the consumer. The consumer just wants to get the information; it
        shouldn't have to know what the underlying structure was.

20      What is a Vocabulary?

        Making sure concerns, questions raised in 2 appends below are addressed in 
        section 8 of specs:

        - http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/09/msg00002.html

        From ed technologies such as 'Recommendation Engines' known
        from Business Intelligence. See http://www-db.stanford.edu/~echang/

21     How should vocabularies appear in the spec and in which levels?

       how much of the vocabulary management issue really belongs in our spec explicitly,
       instead of being considered a "meta" problem that "everyone" will have to deal
       with?

       We would like our basic specification to not rely on some vocabulary manager at
       least at the lowest level. We will pick a vocab or two and just use it.

       A  generic vocabulary management will not be part of the INFOD specification.

       The INFOD registry, however, will support elementary vocabulary
       functionality.

          * The INFOD registry will be able to determine which objects
	    support which vocabulary by comparing the vocabulary type
	    (e.g., XML, SQL) and the name of the vocabulary.

          * If a vocabulary represents an XML schema and an expression
	    is within the boundaries of XQuery, the INFOD registry
	    will be able to determine if an expression is valid.

	Additional vocabulary support has to be given by the
	publishers (and maybe) the subscribers. If an expression
	references a non-XML vocabulary, publisher will be requested
	to validate the expressions

	There will be no support for vocabulary transformation; a
	publisher will not be identified even if the publishers could
	provide information when using a transformation. This function
	will be deferred until there is a generic vocabulary support.

        Maybe we won't need this at all

23      How does INFOD relate to OREP?

        OREP includes in its charter replication specifications so positioning is necessary
        between OREP (file only ?) and INFOD.

24      How do security issues apear in the spec?

        One specific aspect is how registry decides who can delete the
        publication_types and other objects?

27      What's special about INFOD disseminators?

        * Retention of information
        * Querying information
        * Auditing and tracking

28      Do we need a general interface for verifying specifications against
        a vocabulary.

        This is something we had been avoiding so far - but it appears
	to be very necessary for the proper functioning of the
	registry. It might be interal to the registry, or it might be
	externalized to other infod actors.  Which should it be?

 	Concensus seems to be, at least for now, that it is internal
	to the registry.
