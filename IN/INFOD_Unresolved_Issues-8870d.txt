2       What are components of the manifest section of the infod data (and metadata) 
        message?

        this is the message that is sent to the consume or notifyupdate operations.
        
        Once that is described, scenarios like rgma can decide whether they can use that
        format to publish and essentially support the PO Box at the publisher site

8       How does registry handles EPRs, especially when logical EPRs for
        expressions?

        logicalEPRs don't current support expressions - define how to
        do so - indirection

        Shailendra will contact Abdeslem and Cecile if necessary

        ResolveEPR is in spec


23      How does INFOD relate to OREP?

        OREP includes in its charter replication specifications so positioning is necessary
        between OREP (file only ?) and INFOD.
