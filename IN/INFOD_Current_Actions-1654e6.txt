10      Update R-GMA scenario with operations as per Chicago F2F June 05
 
        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Steve F
        - Target date: 29 Nov 2005

        This cannot be performed until a later INFOD spec supports the POBOX


21      Update the charter, to reflect new schedule

        The text has been simplified

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - Owners: Susan 
        - target date: 27 Oct 2005 


22      Produce a plan for at least two implementations

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - Owner: 
        - target date: GGF16

        This may be hard to do - Arjun
        Dieter will send a document about ref implementations


28      Produce interaction diagram to guide readers in understanding general usage

        - Date: 21 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Chris
        - target date: 29 Nov 2005

        Some progress made 


29      Write up consumer service requirement - is this addressed by POBOX?

        - Date: 21 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Steve F.
        - Target date: 29 Nov 2005


31      Define late binding and determine where late binding is supported

        Expanding recipient list from logical EPR?

        - Date: 21 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
        - Target date: Not in base spec


36      Look at WSN to see how they have cleaned up soap/web-services header
        contents description

        - Date: 25 Aug 2005
        - Owner: Arjun
        - Target date: 17 Nov 2005


43     Describe the two approaches:
        (1) Re-pacakaging a message at each hop in a new header
        (2) Removing the header and adding a new appropriate message
            header after transformation

        The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
        which is currently locked.

	  Since the get data call returns just the body of the
	  message. In my understanding we need another call:
	  getMsgInfo,+which will return an opaque message metadata
	  back to the client.  The client can call getAttribute on
	  this opaque data to get the necessary info.  Similiarly the
	  publish call needs to take this opaque data as an Argument
	  which can be populated through setAttribute call.  The
	  getAttribute, setAttribute operate on a descriptor and one
	  of the ways we populate them is as under:

	  SetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);
	  GetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005

       Cecile is not happy with this yet


45     Describe the behavior of DestinationEPRs and MessageIds in 
       an INFOD system

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:

          MessageIds are universaly unique ids and are created at the
	  time of publish. Messages can be correlated using the
	  correlation id. The uniqueness of MessageIds is very useful
	  in P2P protocols and message recovery after instance
	  failure.

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005

       Cecile still needs to check


46     Justify message structure and map to the patterns.

       This should resolve issue 2

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra and Vijay
       - Target: 1 Dec 2005


48     Define sequence number,operationalCharacteristics more clearly

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:


          Sequence no is used to group messages based on message/selector
          attributes. The publish and getData api needs to enhanced
	  substantialy to handle grouped messages.

          Here is an example: Consider a set of messages which need to be
          Grouped together:
        
            We call begin_group() which establishes the group context.

            Now call publish() once for each message in the group.

            Call end_group().

            The Api?s implicitly associate sequence no. for each
            message in the group.

          Now on the get side:

            Call get_first_group() which establishes the message group
            context.

            Call get first message using the group context. 

	    Now   call get_next message until all messages in a group are  exhausted.

	    Now call get_next_group and so on.

          This allows a user to manipulate a group of messages.

        Then it will be DONE

       - Target: 31 Oct 2005

       Cecile to check


49     Reconsider the manifest name and to give it a name that is
       consistent with its content.

       Webster dictionary defines Manifest as ?To be the evidence off?,
       The content of the manifest reveals routing information of a
       message.

       Steve F is unhappy with this and so takes the action over 

       The agreed word is "Trail". The change needs to go into the
       Spec then it will be DONE

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Cecile
       - Target: 10 Nov 2005


50     Explain the need for incorporating information in the INFOD
       messages to deal with the integration of SOAP and asynchronous
       messaging

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra and Vijay
       - Target: 1 Dec 2005


51     Add a subscriber id to the create subscription interface

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Dieter
       - Target: 10 Nov 2005

        Delivered to Cecile when it can be marked as DONE
        Not done yet.


52     Explore the use of the subscription interface with the registry
       manager to notify publishers and consumers of changes to the
       contents of the registry manager (e.g., changes to
       subscriptions, changes to publishers, changes to consumers) -
       in other words explore the registry manager acting as a
       publisher

       This should resolve issue 7
