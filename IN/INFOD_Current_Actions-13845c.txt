24      Document in specs summary of issues raised in Vijay's original append - and resolutions - 
        and validate still accurate with existing infod specs: 
        - declarative vs descriptive interfaces
        - type of data/temporal/meta events defined in infod
        - consumption

        See http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00004.html
        and summarize resolutions as per:
                - http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00005.html

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and operators. But our
        query semantics might be different than those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful
        about how we structure the registry to allow it.

        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and
        change management of resources) is not part of the INFOD scope
        yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model,
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to
        record responsibility for the change, time when a version
        becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when
        this version is valid, etc.  Document current positioning wrt
        to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or
        align with WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA
        Basic Profile Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There is
        no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

        Now just needs writing up

        However we now think that WSRF should be optional - but still
        needs writing up.

        Needs comments on section 3

        Remove section 3.9 and don't expose yet as WS resources
