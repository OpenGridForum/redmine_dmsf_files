2       What are components of the manifest section of the infod data (and metadata) message?

        this is the message that is sent to the consume or notifyupdate operations.
        
        Once that is described, scenarios like rgma can decide whether they can use that
        format to publish and essentially support the PO Box at the publisher site

7       How are registry object updates  broadcasted to interested infod player

        for ex, how new subscriptions are found by publishers - 
        
        describe how notifying/finding appropriate consumers for metadata 
        messages - specs don't do it now (notifyUpdate interface half spec'ed)
        and we didn't discuss at F2F (Animation scenario feedback)

        A dup issue: due to the dynamic nature of publications, publishers, etc., a subscription
        may need to include information about how to notify consumers of changes to the
        subscription dependencies (additional publishers, removal of publishers that occur
        over time, etc.). 
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/03/msg00029.html

        What is the interaction between parameters of subscription - their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may interact with each
        other (what happens if data filter exists but not association, or if both exist,
        or none...) - Describing interaction will help readers understand these components
        better and simplify section 3 as at least one is required  but not clear what
        non-provided parm means (means all as in '*' or means NULL...).


	These are the interactions between the INFOD registry and the INFOD objects:

          * The objects request modifications through the
            create/alter/dropINFODResource interface In response to
            such a request the INFOD registry will identify with
	    publishers are publishing or are able to publish the
	    requested information and limit the selection using any
	    criteria that is part of the publisher and consumer
	    specification.

	  * If the INFOD registry is unable to verify the expression
	    related to the data it will request verification by at
	    least one publisher using a web services interface.

          * If requested the subscriber will be notified - using the
            consumption interface - to select publishers and subscribers of
	    interest.

          * If requested the publisher will be notified - using the
	    consumption interface - about the changes:
	    new/changed/dropped subscriptions and new/changed/dropped
	    subscribers.

        Note:

	  * If the publisher (or subscriber) has not implemented the
	    consumption interface the information will be made
	    available using the POBOX. That is associated to an INFOD
	    registry.

11      How does INFOD relate to WS-RF and WS-ResourceLifetime?
        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and change management of resources)
        is not part of the INFOD scope yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model, 
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to record responsibility for the change,
        time when a version becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when this version is valid,
        etc. 
        Document current positioning wrt to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or align with 
        WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA Basic Profile
        Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:   
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There
        is no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

13	How do WS-Eventing, WS-N and INFOD relate and can we provide INFOD
	services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify

        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

14      How do we break the spec into multiple documents defining different levels of INFOD?

        decomposition of interfaces, and factoring of this specification into related specification 
        documents

        The proposed factoring is as follows, from simple to more complex scenarios:

        - Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers, allowing subscribers to subscribe 
          on behalf of 3rd party consumers
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators, but without propagation 
          requirements between disseminators (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide 
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and with possible propagation 
          between disseminators (delivery of the ‘intelligent cloud’ of figure 2 above).

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of Requirements, and pick a few that
        are doable short term, and use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each other (ie common short term
        items from both)

        Is file replication part of INFOD, or OREP ? and if part of INFOD, part of base specs ?
        (ref: http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        Have it aligned with wsn base: have infod base, one for broker - disseminator(s)

15      Which (if any) components support transformations?

        Are they supported by consumptions?  consumption  has different  use-cases:
        replication,  fan-out with same subscription and different consumer
        transforms, different channel    options for a given consumer,

18      Should we be looking at other rule specifications and consolidate/align with them?

        E.g. This applies to transform definitions. Specs need to document approach taken.

        Also we are oriented towards putting things in multiple queues right now.  But the 
	consumer may not want to be able to see those queues, especially cross-VO. So we
        need a mechanism for replaying past events without the producer understanding the
        ID structure of the consumer. The consumer just wants to get the information; it
        shouldn't have to know what the underlying structure was.

21     How should vocabularies appear in the spec and in which levels?

       how much of the vocabulary management issue really belongs in our spec explicitly,
       instead of being considered a "meta" problem that "everyone" will have to deal
       with?

       We would like our basic specification to not rely on some vocabulary manager at
       least at the lowest level. We will pick a vocab or two and just use it.

       A  generic vocabulary management will not be part of the INFOD specification.

       The INFOD registry, however, will support elementary vocabulary
       functionality.

          * The INFOD registry will be able to determine which objects
	    support which vocabulary by comparing the vocabulary type
	    (e.g., XML, SQL) and the name of the vocabulary.

          * If a vocabulary represents an XML schema and an expression
	    is within the boundaries of XQuery, the INFOD registry
	    will be able to determine if an expression is valid.

	Additional vocabulary support has to be given by the
	publishers (and maybe) the subscribers. If an expression
	references a non-XML vocabulary, publisher will be requested
	to validate the expressions

	There will be no support for vocabulary transformation; a
	publisher will not be identified even if the publishers could
	provide information when using a transformation. This function
	will be deferred until there is a generic vocabulary support.

26      How do operational things appear in the spec?
    
        This info that applies to INFOD resources is not specifically addressed in this version 
        of the specifications. 
    
        How does OGSA do active management of resources? Typically, the resource is
        expected to be queryable. We propose to use a MIB-style structure ("resource
        properties") at the producers/consumers/disseminators to control them. We would
        prefer not to burden the registry with this functionality.  OGSA is currently
        proposing to use the OASIS WS-DistributedManagement for this functionality for
        hardware-style management, but it might be too low-level for INFOD.

        There was some discussion about what this meant. It would appear that stopping a
        service is out of scope but that suspending a suncsription - i.e. an operation on
        the registry contents, is in scope.

28      Do we need a general interface for verifying specifications against
        a vocabulary.

        This is something we had been avoiding so far - but it appears
	to be very necessary for the proper functioning of the
	registry. It might be interal to the registry, or it might be
	externalized to other infod actors.  Which should it be?

 	Concensus seems to be, at least for now, that it is internal
	to the registry.
