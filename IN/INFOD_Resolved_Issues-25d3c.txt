INFOD Resolved Issues
=====================

This is a list of resolved issues.

==============================================================================


1       What is infod scope wrt publishers and when infod influences messages and when it doesn't?

        the stages involved are creation of messages (which infod can influence), making 
        messages available for transmission, and actual dissemination of messages. We end
        up discussing scope of infod over and over again, either when asking if infod
        publishers may publish without subscriptions, or infod publishers may support 
        the equivalent of a dpublish, etc.  So what is needed is clear statement on scope
        of infod as it relates to the infod influence on message lifetime.
        - description of item in Chicago f2f chat section 10:10:49 on 6/27  
        - action item is to add description in Ch1 of specs to hopefully clarify scope.

        There are three distinct stages in the Publishing process

	(1) Observation of the Situation and its noteworthy characteristics;

	(2) Creation of the NotificationMessage artifact that captures the
	    noteworthy characteristics of the Situation; and

	(3) Distribution of copies of the NotificationMessage to zero or more
  	    interested parties.

	Stages (1) and (2) happen largely outside of the scope of the
	WS-Notification architecture; WSN does not restrict the means by which
	these stages must occur. WSN refers to an entity that performs stages 1 and
	2 as a Publisher

	INFOD enables subscribers to influence (1) and (2) by
	explicitly permitting subscribers to refer to predefined or
	application defined situations and to cause the publisher to
	execute processes (usually pre-installed) that issue messages
	that correspond to the subscribers requirements

        A publisher is an entity that creates messages. There are
        three stages involved in the creation of a messages before it
        is distributed to consumers

           * detection of an event of interest

	   * Creation of an appropriate message

	   * making that message ready for distribution

        The publisher may control the first two stages or, if it is a
        web service, it may allow other entities (subscribers) to
        specify at run time what an event is and what messages to
        create. These advanced capabilities are specific to InfoD and
        provide more fine-grained control on what gets published, in a
        dynamic way.

	For stage three, the publisher either

	   * takes on the duty of distributing messages to relevant
             consumers. In this case stages 2 and 3 are the same. or

	   * pushes those messages to a Disseminator (this is stage 3)
             that will distribute them to relevant consumers on its
             behalf.

	A publisher that also distributes messages, may obtain the
	list of consumers through an out of band mechanism or by
	querying the InfoDregistry. If the publisher wishes to be
	discovered by potential subscribers it must register itself in
	the InfoDregistry. If it wishes to be notified about changes
	to relevant consumers and subscribers, it needs to be a web
	services and subscribe for notifications with the
	InfoDregistry.

4       Should a publication "do" anything?

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything. 

        The answer is no - this will be part of Action 5

9       How does the registry decide who can delete the publication_types and other objects?

        This will be addressed as part of issue 24

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - tentative Owner: need to ask Vijay to document summary of the requirement - eventual proposal
            - target date: 
                - after documenting requirement, propose to defer item 
                  & use rationale from DAIS for which it is also deferred (ask Susan for it)
        - dependent upon issue 7
        - Resolved: 14 Jul 2005


10      What is the interaction between parameters of subscription - their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may interact with each
        other (what happens if data filter exists but not association, or if both exist,
        or none...) - Describing interaction will help readers understand these components
        better and simplify section 3 as at least one is required  but not clear what
        non-provided parm means (means all as in '*' or means NULL...)

        This will be addressed as part of issue 7

19      Do we need the event taxonomy mentioned in the glossary?

        Yes - this will be mentioned as part of action 20
