1       Add reference to appropriate appendix, or description for
        vocabulary, identity management, etc.
        
        in Page 5, para 2: we need references or brief explanation of
        vocabulary, identity management and principal as they all have
        a meaning which is peculiar to their context.

3       After much discussion about using WSDM to stop/start our services,
        we decide that we agree that starting/stopping our service is out of
        scope - so add to non-goals of INFOD.

5       Go over list of questions, clarifications addressed for chapter 1 in 
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00001.html
        (ch 2 questions have an open item for them)

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything.

23     Provide response to document proposed by Vijay on infod suggested service modifications:

           - publication regenerate - some services can regenerate some cannot  and need to cache 
           - aspects of analyst role 
           - lifetime management 
           - and new point - Clarification: A publication can be viewed as a reaction to a query 
             however the format of the published material may need to be considered or specified 
             separately  

        See

24      Document in specs summary of issues raised in Vijay's original append - and resolutions - 
        and validate still accurate with existing infod specs: 
        - declarative vs descriptive interfaces
        - type of data/temporal/meta events defined in infod
        - consumption

        See http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00004.html

25     Define relationship between Infod AND DAIS
        
        - document current positioning 
        - resolve lifetime issues of INFOD objects vs DAIS sessions
        - 3rd party delivery support  
        - This should probably go into a use case

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and operators. But our
        query semantics might be different than those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful
        about how we structure the registry to allow it.

35      Break the spec into multiple logical documents defining different
        levels of INFOD

        OGSA profiles mandate base WSN. To be compliant we need to
        refactor around base notifications now and provide INFOD
        services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify?

        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00010.html
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/12/msg00000.html

        Questions to address include: How does WS-Eventing fit in?
        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

        One proposal was to split:

        o Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers,
          allowing subscribers to subscribe on behalf of 3rd party
          consumers

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators,
          but without propagation requirements between disseminators
          (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and
          with possible propagation between disseminators (delivery of
          the "intelligent cloud"

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of
        Requirements, and pick a few that are doable short term, and
        use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each
        other (ie common short term items from both)
