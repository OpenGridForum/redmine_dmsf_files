4       Should a publication "do" anything?

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything. 

        The answer is no - this will be part of Action 5

9       How does the registry decide who can delete the publication_types and other objects?

        This will be addressed as part of issue 24

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - tentative Owner: need to ask Vijay to document summary of the requirement - eventual proposal
            - target date: 
                - after documenting requirement, propose to defer item 
                  & use rationale from DAIS for which it is also deferred (ask Susan for it)
        - dependent upon issue 7
        - Resolved: 14 Jul 2005


10      What is the interaction between parameters of subscription - their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may interact with each
        other (what happens if data filter exists but not association, or if both exist,
        or none...) - Describing interaction will help readers understand these components
        better and simplify section 3 as at least one is required  but not clear what
        non-provided parm means (means all as in '*' or means NULL...)

        This will be addressed as part of issue 7

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Dieter

19      Do we need the event taxonomy mentioned in the glossary?

        Yes - this will be mentioned as part of action 20
