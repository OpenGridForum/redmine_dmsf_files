1       What is infod scope wrt publishers and when infod influences messages and when it doesn't?

        the stages involved are creation of messages (which infod can influence), making 
        messages available for transmission, and actual dissemination of messages. We end
        up discussing scope of infod over and over again, either when asking if infod
        publishers may publish without subscriptions, or infod publishers may support 
        the equivalent of a dpublish, etc.  So what is needed is clear statement on scope
        of infod as it relates to the infod influence on message lifetime.
        - description of item in Chicago f2f chat section 10:10:49 on 6/27  
        - action item is to add description in Ch1 of specs to hopefully clarify scope.

2       What are components of the manifest section of the infod data (and metadata) message?

        this is the message that is sent to the consume or notifyupdate operations.
        
        Once that is described, scenarios like rgma can decide whether they can use that
        format to publish and essentially support the PO Box at the publisher site

                - dependency on infod object schemas more or less finalized 


3       Is PO Box at the publisher site supported in infod?

        RGMA scenario: publish against a publisher allowed ?
        SensorNet also: infod recommendation on granularity of publisher to be documented

5       Do we need consumptions as well as subscriptions?

7       How are registry object updates  broadcasted to interested infod player

        for ex, how new subscriptions are found by publishers - 
        
        describe how notifying/finding appropriate consumers for metadata 
        messages - specs don't do it now (notifyUpdate interface half spec'ed)
        and we didn't discuss at F2F (Animation scenario feedback)

        A dup issue: due to the dynamic nature of publications, publishers, etc., a subscription
        may need to include information about how to notify consumers of changes to the
        subscription dependencies (additional publishers, removal of publishers that occur
        over time, etc.). 
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/03/msg00029.html

        What is the interaction between parameters of subscription - their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may interact with each
        other (what happens if data filter exists but not association, or if both exist,
        or none...) - Describing interaction will help readers understand these components
        better and simplify section 3 as at least one is required  but not clear what
        non-provided parm means (means all as in '*' or means NULL...).

8	How does registry handles EPRs, especially when logical EPRs for expressions?

        logicalEPRs don't current support expressions - define how to do so - indirection

11      How does INFOD relate to WS-RF and WS-ResourceLifetime?
        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and change management of resources)
        is not part of the INFOD scope yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model, 
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to record responsibility for the change,
        time when a version becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when this version is valid,
        etc. 
        Document current positioning wrt to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or align with 
        WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA Basic Profile
        Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:   
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There
        is no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

13	How do WS-Eventing, WS-N and INFOD relate and can we provide INFOD
	services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify

14      How do we break the spec into multiple documents defining differetn levels of INFOD?

        decomposition of interfaces, and factoring of this specification into related specification 
        documents

        The proposed factoring is as follows, from simple to more complex scenarios:

        - Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers, allowing subscribers to subscribe 
          on behalf of 3rd party consumers
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators, but without propagation 
          requirements between disseminators (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide 
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and with possible propagation 
          between disseminators (delivery of the ‘intelligent cloud’ of figure 2 above).

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of Requirements, and pick a few that
        are doable short term, and use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each other (ie common short term
        items from both)

        Is file replication part of INFOD, or OREP ? and if part of INFOD, part of base specs ?
        (ref: http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        Have it aligned with wsn base: have infod base, one for broker - disseminator(s)

15      Which (if any) components support transformations?

        Are they supported by consumptions?  consumption  has different  use-cases:
        replication,  fan-out with same subscription and different consumer
        transforms, different channel    options for a given consumer,

18      Should we be looking at other rule specifications and consolidate/align with them?

        E.g. This applies to transform definitions. Specs need to document approach taken.

        Also we are oriented towards putting things in multiple queues right now.  But the 
	consumer may not want to be able to see those queues, especially cross-VO. So we
        need a mechanism for replaying past events without the producer understanding the
        ID structure of the consumer. The consumer just wants to get the information; it
        shouldn't have to know what the underlying structure was.

20      What is a Vocabulary?

        Making sure concerns, questions raised in 2 appends below are addressed in 
        section 8 of specs:
        - http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/02/msg00014.html
        - http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/09/msg00002.html

        From ed technologies such as 'Recommendation Engines' known
        from Business Intelligence. See http://www-db.stanford.edu/~echang/

21     How should vocabularies appear in the spec and in which levels?

       how much of the vocabulary management issue really belongs in our spec explicitly,
       instead of being considered a "meta" problem that "everyone" will have to deal
       with?

       We would like our basic specification to not rely on some vocabulary manager at
       least at the lowest level. We will pick a vocab or two and just use it.

23      How does INFOD relate to OREP?

        OREP includes in its charter replication specifications so positioning is necessary
        between OREP (file only ?) and INFOD.

24      How do security issues apear in the spec?

        One specific aspect is how registry decides who can delete the publication_types and other objects?

26      How do operational things appear in the spec?
    
        This info that applies to INFOD resources is not specifically addressed in this version 
        of the specifications. 
    
        How does OGSA do active management of resources? Typically, the resource is
        expected to be queryable. We propose to use a MIB-style structure ("resource
        properties") at the producers/consumers/disseminators to control them. We would
        prefer not to burden the registry with this functionality.  OGSA is currently
        proposing to use the OASIS WS-DistributedManagement for this functionality for
        hardware-style management, but it might be too low-level for INFOD.

        There was some discussion about what this meant. It would appear that stopping a
        service is out of scope but that suspending a suncsription - i.e. an operation on
        the registry contents, is in scope.
