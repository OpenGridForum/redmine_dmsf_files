Information Dissemination BOF (INFOD-WG)
========================================

Susan Malaika, IBM


motivation:
   replication, third party delivery and sub-patterns

goals:
   define operations and interfaces necessary to support information dissemination
   define realizations for typical scenarios to hide the complexity of the wide-range of infod options
   position the infod model within ws-notification


scenarios:

   A: spam pattern:    pushing stuff to consumer directly
   B: pub sub pattern: publisher publishes to a broker, consumer receives material on demand
   C: sub pub pattern: consumer asks for stuff and publisher publishes on demand according to subscriptions

Q: will we address all scenarios - there is a possible overlap with other groups
A: to be defined

Q: will use cases be sufficient to drive us
A: we have quite a lot from the DAIS work

----------------------

pub-sub scenarios:
  - send a message to me and then try to call me over phone
  - send message to bill or call information
  - send message to all car dealers within 10 miles who have
    an interesting rate for a given model - spam, pub/sub combination?

Q: late binding?
A: yes

reaching any mix of consumers

publishing relevant info

 - publishers have to capture the right info. there is no limit on what *could* be of interest
 - base publication on subscription requests! demand driven publication
 - this function complements the pull-data access

business scenarios

 - replication: replicate selected info to selected recipients as it becomes available
 - EAL workflow 
 - Business activity monitoring
 - Radio Frequency identifyers

basic models

 - elements: publisher, consumer. publisher ---comm channel---> consumer

extended model

 - add registry
 - publisher, consumer and registry of profiles 
 - reg. for publishers: name, what info is available, language to specify interest
 - reg. for subscribers: name, when and what is of interest, what should be done if info is available

operational characteristics

 - # messages per second
 - # of subscribers
 - security
 - transactions

Q: you assume that all consumers are registered - can this be avoided
A: Yes

Q: How can you do it without a trigger mechanism (i.e. acount going below some level)
A: This is a model - need suitable implementation

Q: It would be to be able to be able to define in terms of composition of services
A: This sounds like a good direction - but not there yet

Q: how does it relate to Grids?
A: it is an extension of DAIS when timeliness is important

Q: Are there a lot of security implications
A: yes

Q: this is powerful - but will it scale down well. Can we cope with
the overheads? Perhaps turn off the slow bits e.g. avoid late binding
as necessary
A: We are doign it now

Q: is this WG or RG - there is a lot of research needed
A: WG 

Q: what is diff between data movement and dissemination
A: dissemination is an informed movement of data

DAIS presentation - relation to INFOD

- Requirements identified need to deliver data to and from 3rd parties
  x event notifications
  x distributed/federated queries
  x immediate and deferred result set delivery
- data movement out of scope

- info based discovery in science needs
  x topic based sub
  x publishing relevant info

- business scenarios have equivalents

- timely delivery of info

OREP presentation - relation to INFOD


Ann proposes to get rid of OREP and go under the INFOD umbrella

Various opinions are expressed, for and against



Steve Fisher
------------

RGMA

presents RGMA features etc

- difference to suggested INFOD path: registry is hidden, in INFOD it's exposed.
- use relational model explicitly
- only relation to others is logging.
- INFOD should be active in the relation to OGSA


Discussion of Charter and next steps
------------------------------------

relation to wsrf, ws-notification

question is how narrow/wide you want to have the charter.
charter: define interfaces necessary to support INFOD
         define realizations for typical scenarios
         

 aim is to define a type of pub-sub?
 strong collision with 4 other groups! logging, ws-notification etc.
 everyone is trying to be a fundamental mechanism..

 work to be done in description
 work to be done for positioning wrt other groups

 should abstract out of delivery system and other systems the notion of
 matching publishers and subscribers which can be composed of other
 systems


Q: Are the collisions with other working groups avoidable
A: Overlaps are a real concern - but until some work is done can we know?

There was general agreement that this is a useful activity with good
support from the community.

An announcement will go to the data area and dais list when SourceForge goes ahead.
