1       Add reference to appropriate appendix, or description for
        vocabulary, identity management, etc.
        
        in Page 5, para 2: we need references or brief explanation of
        vocabulary, identity management and principal as they all have
        a meaning which is peculiar to their context.

5       go over list of questions, clarifications addressed for chapter 1 in 
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00001.html
        (ch 2 questions have an open item for them)

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything.

23     Provide response to document proposed by Vijay on infod suggested service modifications:

           - publication regenerate - some services can regenerate some cannot  and need to cache 
           - aspects of analyst role

           - and new point - Clarification: A publication can be viewed as a reaction to a query

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and operators. But our
        query semantics might be different than those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful
        about how we structure the registry to allow it.
