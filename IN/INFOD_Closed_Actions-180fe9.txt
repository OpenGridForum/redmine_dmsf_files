        vocabulary, identity management, etc.
        
        in Page 5, para 2: we need references or brief explanation of
        vocabulary, identity management and principal as they all have
        a meaning which is peculiar to their context.

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and
        operators. But our query semantics might be different than
        those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful about how we
        structure the registry to allow it.

        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and
        change management of resources) is not part of the INFOD scope
        yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model,
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to
        record responsibility for the change, time when a version
        becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when
        this version is valid, etc.  Document current positioning wrt
        to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or
        align with WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA
        Basic Profile Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There is
        no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

        Now just needs writing up

        However we now think that WSRF should be optional - but still
        needs writing up.

        Needs comments on section 3

        Remove section 3.9 and don't expose yet as WS resources

32      Define non-events - are they deadline related?

        Dieter has produced the following text. It does not appear to
        fit into any of our current documents:

	  INFOD uses the terms states, events, and messages. Messages
	  report about events; events are the consequence of state
	  changes. State changes require a temporal data model; i.e.,
	  the ability to compare a state with previous states. By
	  definition an event has happened when an expression or
	  constraint becomes true after a state transition. This model
	  represents an extension of the normalization model of
	  temporal databases.

	  Temporal database technology also looks at the duration of
	  an expression remaining true in the presence of state
	  changes. If the length for a condition to remain true should
	  be limited, one expects two state changes (events), one when
	  entering a state where the condition becomes true and one
	  entering a state where the condition is not true anymore.
	  If the second state change (event) does not happen within a
	  given time limit, it is important to create awareness of
	  this fact by creating an alternative events.

	  The alternative event is often perceived as a non-event; it
	  got created because the expected event did not happen in
	  time; or using another view: a deadline has been missed.

35      Break the spec into multiple logical documents defining different
        levels of INFOD.

        OGSA profiles mandate base WSN. To be compliant we need to
        refactor around base notifications now and provide INFOD
        services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify?

        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00010.html
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/12/msg00000.html

        Questions to address include: How does WS-Eventing fit in?
        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

        One proposal was to split:

        o Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers,
          allowing subscribers to subscribe on behalf of 3rd party
          consumers

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators,
          but without propagation requirements between disseminators
          (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and
          with possible propagation between disseminators (delivery of
          the "intelligent cloud"

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of
        Requirements, and pick a few that are doable short term, and
        use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each
        other (ie common short term items from both)

        Amount of information points to two documents (not three as
        initially thought).  First document with base functionality.
        Rest in second document.

          MessageIds are universaly unique ids and are created at the
	  time of publish. Messages can be correlated using the
	  correlation id. The uniqueness of MessageIds is very useful
	  in P2P protocols and message recovery after instance
	  failure.

46     Justify message structure and map to the patterns.

       This should resolve issue 2

       In addition to properties supported by most messaging systems
       such as JMS and CORBA that treat messages as lightweight
       entities consisting of a header and a body, INFOD provides
       additional features to enable message tracking and additional
       routing capabilities. For example, the message ids allow the
       messages to be uniquely attributed to the publishers and
       uniquely identify its dissemination path. The header contains
       fields used for message routing and identification; the body
       contains the application data being sent. The semantics of the
       header elements are as follows:

       - Id \226 Uniquely identifies a message and attributes it to a
       verifiable publisher.

       - Length \226 The length of the message, including manifest and
       payload.

       - Type \226 Uniquely identifies a message type, for xml message
       types this refers to xsd format of the message.

       - Correlation Id \226 Uniquely identifies a group of
       messages. For multiple nested groupings multiple correlation
       ids may be associated with the message.

       - Priority \226 A sender provided priority associated with the
       message.

       - Retry \226 The number of times the disseminator will retry to
       deliver this message. The sender specifies this parameter for
       enactment by the disseminator.

       - SenderEPR \226 End point reference to enable any routing node
       to be able to interact with the sender.

       - DestinationEPR \226 The end destination EPR where the message
       routing needs to be terminated.

       - OriginalId \226 A message may have resulted by split, merge
       or join of different messages, the original id points to the
       originating message.

       - SequenceNo \226 For ordered delivery of message in a
       correlation (as specified by CorrelationId) the sequence number
       specifies the order of consumption of message. This number does
       not mean that sequence will be observed at each stage of
       routing, but is required to be enforced at the point of
       consumption.

       - Signature \226 The encryption key for the message.

       - EncryptionAlgorithm \226 The name of the encryption
       algorithm.

       - Characterset \226 The character set for the message.

       - Form \226 single or multi-byte character set

       - OpChar \226 operational characteristics.

       - userProperty \226 A set of user defined name value pairs.

       - Flags \226 A set of property attributes for message routing.

       Patterns for dissemination

       Following are the important properties of various message deliveries

       - Ordered sequence of message delivery

       &#61607; Create a correlationId to identify a sequence.

       &#61607; Associate an incremental sequenceNo with each message.

       &#61607; End the sequence by creating new correlations.

       - Transactional message delivery

       &#61607; Create a correlationid

       &#61607; Set routing flags for transactional and guaranteed
       delivery.

       &#61607; Set retry to allow recovery while routing

       &#61607; Create nested correlationid at each stage of
       propagation in the dissemination network.

       &#61607; Set acknowledgement flag on at each step of routing.

       - Broadcast of messages

       &#61607; SetDestinationEPR to NULL

       &#61607; Retry will be ignored by disseminator.

       &#61607; Priority may be ignored by disseminator.

49     Reconsider the manifest name and to give it a name that is
       consistent with its content.

       Webster dictionary defines Manifest as ?To be the evidence off?,
       The content of the manifest reveals routing information of a
       message.

       Steve F is unhappy with this and so takes the action over 

       The agreed word is "Trail". The change needs to go into the
       Spec then it will be DONE

       Changes consist of 'Manifest' will be changed to 'Trail' in 3.9.1,
       typo in message: 'body' should be actually 'trail' and finally trail
       should be defined as an array.
