24      Document in specs summary of issues raised in Vijay's original
        append - and resolutions - and validate still accurate with
        existing infod specs:

        - declarative vs descriptive interfaces
        - type of data/temporal/meta events defined in infod
        - consumption

        See http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00004.html
        and summarize resolutions as per:

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and
        operators. But our query semantics might be different than
        those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful about how we
        structure the registry to allow it.

        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and
        change management of resources) is not part of the INFOD scope
        yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model,
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to
        record responsibility for the change, time when a version
        becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when
        this version is valid, etc.  Document current positioning wrt
        to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or
        align with WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA
        Basic Profile Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There is
        no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

        Now just needs writing up

        However we now think that WSRF should be optional - but still
        needs writing up.

        Needs comments on section 3

        Remove section 3.9 and don't expose yet as WS resources

42     Remove body from the the message header section and add
       comments for every attribute

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005

       Has been DONE but the spec is currently locked by Cecile


43     Describe the two approaches:
        (1) Re-pacakaging a message at each hop in a new header
        (2) Removing the header and adding a new appropriate message
            header after transformation

        The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
        which is currently locked.

	  Since the get data call returns just the body of the
	  message. In my understanding we need another call:
	  getMsgInfo,+which will return an opaque message metadata
	  back to the client.  The client can call getAttribute on
	  this opaque data to get the necessary info.  Similiarly the
	  publish call needs to take this opaque data as an Argument
	  which can be populated through setAttribute call.  The
	  getAttribute, setAttribute operate on a descriptor and one
	  of the ways we populate them is as under:

	  SetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);
	  GetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);

        Then it will be DONE

45     Describe the behavior of DestinationEPRs and MessageIds in 
       an INFOD system

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:

          MessageIds are universaly unique ids and are created at the
	  time of publish. Messages can be correlated using the
	  correlation id. The uniqueness of MessageIds is very useful
	  in P2P protocols and message recovery after instance
	  failure.

        Then it will be DONE

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile

46     Justify message structure and map to the patterns.

       This should resolve issue 2

       - Target: 31 Oct 2005


48     Define sequence number,operationalCharacteristics more clearly

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:


          Sequence no is used to group messages based on message/selector
          attributes. The publish and getData api needs to enhanced
	  substantialy to handle grouped messages.

          Here is an example: Consider a set of messages which need to be
          Grouped together:
        
            We call begin_group() which establishes the group context.

            Now call publish() once for each message in the group.

            Call end_group().

            The Api?s implicitly associate sequence no. for each
            message in the group.

          Now on the get side:

            Call get_first_group() which establishes the message group
            context.

            Call get first message using the group context. 

	    Now   call get_next message until all messages in a group are  exhausted.

	    Now call get_next_group and so on.

          This allows a user to manipulate a group of messages.

        Then it will be DONE

49     Reconsider the manifest name and to give it a name that is
       consistent with its content.

       Webster dictionary defines Manifest as ?To be the evidence off?,
       The content of the manifest reveals routing information of a
       message.
