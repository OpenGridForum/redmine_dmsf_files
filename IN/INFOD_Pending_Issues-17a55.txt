INFOD Pending Issues
====================

15      Which (if any) components support transformations?

        Are they supported by consumptions? consumption  has
        different use-cases: replication, fan-out with same
        subscription and different consumer transforms, different
        channel options for a given consumer,

17      How do the propagation interface(s) differ from the consume
	interfaces and what is stored in the registry?

18      Should we be looking at other rule specifications and
        consolidate/align with them?

        E.g. This applies to transform definitions. Specs need to
        document approach taken.

        Also we are oriented towards putting things in multiple queues
	right now.  But the consumer may not want to be able to see
	those queues, especially cross-VO. So we need a mechanism for
	replaying past events without the producer understanding the
	ID structure of the consumer. The consumer just wants to get
	the information; it shouldn't have to know what the underlying
	structure was.
