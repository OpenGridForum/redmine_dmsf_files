1       Add reference to appropriate appendix, or description for
        vocabulary, identity management, etc.
        
        in Page 5, para 2: we need references or brief explanation of
        vocabulary, identity management and principal as they all have
        a meaning which is peculiar to their context.

        This is now in the specification

32      Define non-events - are they deadline related?

        Dieter has produced the following text. It does not appear to
        fit into any of our current documents:

	  INFOD uses the terms states, events, and messages. Messages
	  report about events; events are the consequence of state
	  changes. State changes require a temporal data model; i.e.,
	  the ability to compare a state with previous states. By
	  definition an event has happened when an expression or
	  constraint becomes true after a state transition. This model
	  represents an extension of the normalization model of
	  temporal databases.

	  Temporal database technology also looks at the duration of
	  an expression remaining true in the presence of state
	  changes. If the length for a condition to remain true should
	  be limited, one expects two state changes (events), one when
	  entering a state where the condition becomes true and one
	  entering a state where the condition is not true anymore.
	  If the second state change (event) does not happen within a
	  given time limit, it is important to create awareness of
	  this fact by creating an alternative events.

	  The alternative event is often perceived as a non-event; it
	  got created because the expected event did not happen in
	  time; or using another view: a deadline has been missed.

35      Break the spec into multiple logical documents defining different
        levels of INFOD.

        OGSA profiles mandate base WSN. To be compliant we need to
        refactor around base notifications now and provide INFOD
        services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify?

        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00010.html
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/12/msg00000.html

        Questions to address include: How does WS-Eventing fit in?
        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

        One proposal was to split:

        o Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers,
          allowing subscribers to subscribe on behalf of 3rd party
          consumers

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators,
          but without propagation requirements between disseminators
          (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and
          with possible propagation between disseminators (delivery of
          the "intelligent cloud"

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of
        Requirements, and pick a few that are doable short term, and
        use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each
        other (ie common short term items from both)

        Amount of information points to two documents (not three as
        initially thought).  First document with base functionality.
        Rest in second document.

        Moving GetMData description to base document.
