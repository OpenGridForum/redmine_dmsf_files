        This may be hard to do - Arjun


24      Document in specs summary of issues raised in Vijay's original
        append - and resolutions - and validate still accurate with
        existing infod specs:

        - declarative vs descriptive interfaces
        - type of data/temporal/meta events defined in infod
        - consumption

        See http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00004.html
        and summarize resolutions as per:
           http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00005.html
           http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00006.html
           http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00007.html

        Is this still relevant. Cecile will ask Vijay to read it. Reading has been done.

        - Date: 1 Jul 2005
        - Owner: Cecile, Vijay
        - Target date: 3 Nov 2005

        Reported as DONE. Vijay reports that  the use of SQL/XQuery to
        specify the subscription coupled with message structure definitions covers
        the concerns.

40     Discusss with Dieter the vocabulary issuse of 20 and 21 and 28

        - Date 8 Sep 2005
        - Owner: Vijay
        - Target: 10 Nov 2005

        Reported as DONE. Vijay reports that  the use of SQL/XQuery to
        specify the subscription coupled with message structure definitions covers
        the concerns. 

41     Fix section 2 of the specification and make it consistent 
       with section 3.8.1

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Dieter
       - Target: 10 Nov 2005

        Delivered to Cecile when it can be marked as DONE


42     Remove body from the the message header section and add
       comments for every attribute

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005

       Has been DONE but the spec is currently locked by Cecile


43     Describe the two approaches:
        (1) Re-pacakaging a message at each hop in a new header
        (2) Removing the header and adding a new appropriate message
            header after transformation

        The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
        which is currently locked.

	  Since the get data call returns just the body of the
	  message. In my understanding we need another call:
	  getMsgInfo,+which will return an opaque message metadata
	  back to the client.  The client can call getAttribute on
	  this opaque data to get the necessary info.  Similiarly the
	  publish call needs to take this opaque data as an Argument
	  which can be populated through setAttribute call.  The
	  getAttribute, setAttribute operate on a descriptor and one
	  of the ways we populate them is as under:

	  SetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);
	  GetAttribute(MsgDesc, MsgPropertyNm, MsgPropertyVal);

        Then it will be DONE

44     Put mandatory properties together in the message structure

       Has been DONE but the spec is currently locked by Cecile

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005


45     Describe the behavior of DestinationEPRs and MessageIds in 
       an INFOD system

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:

          MessageIds are universaly unique ids and are created at the
	  time of publish. Messages can be correlated using the
	  correlation id. The uniqueness of MessageIds is very useful
	  in P2P protocols and message recovery after instance
	  failure.

        Then it will be DONE

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra, Cecile
       - Target: 20 Oct 2005


46     Justify message structure and map to the patterns.

       This should resolve issue 2

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra and Vijay
       - Target: 1 Dec 2005


48     Define sequence number,operationalCharacteristics more clearly

       The following should be incorporated by Cecile into the spec
       which is currently locked:


          Sequence no is used to group messages based on message/selector
          attributes. The publish and getData api needs to enhanced
	  substantialy to handle grouped messages.

          Here is an example: Consider a set of messages which need to be
          Grouped together:
        
            We call begin_group() which establishes the group context.

            Now call publish() once for each message in the group.

            Call end_group().

            The Api?s implicitly associate sequence no. for each
            message in the group.

          Now on the get side:

            Call get_first_group() which establishes the message group
            context.

            Call get first message using the group context. 

	    Now   call get_next message until all messages in a group are  exhausted.

	    Now call get_next_group and so on.

          This allows a user to manipulate a group of messages.

        Then it will be DONE

       - Date 3 Oct 2005

       - Target: 31 Oct 2005


49     Reconsider the manifest name and to give it a name that is
       consistent with its content.

       Webster dictionary defines Manifest as ?To be the evidence off?,
       The content of the manifest reveals routing information of a
       message.

       Steve F is unhappy with this and so takes the action over 

       The agreed word is "Trail". The change needs to go into the
       Spec then it will be DONE

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Steve F.
       - Target: 10 Nov 2005


50     Explain the need for incorporating information in the INFOD
       messages to deal with the integration of SOAP and asynchronous
       messaging

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Shailendra and Vijay

51     Add a subscriber id to the create subscription interface

       - Date 3 Oct 2005
       - Owner: Dieter
       - Target: 10 Nov 2005

        Delivered to Cecile when it can be marked as DONE


52     Explore the use of the subscription interface with the registry
       manager to notify publishers and consumers of changes to the
       contents of the registry manager (e.g., changes to
       subscriptions, changes to publishers, changes to consumers) -
       in other words explore the registry manager acting as a
       publisher

       This should resolve issue 7

       - Owner: Vijay
       - Target: 1 Dec 2005
