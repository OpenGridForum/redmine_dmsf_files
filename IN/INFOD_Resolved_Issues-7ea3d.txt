INFOD Resolved Issues
=====================

This is a list of resolved issues.

==============================================================================


1       What is infod scope wrt publishers and when infod influences messages and when it doesn't?

        the stages involved are creation of messages (which infod can influence), making 
        messages available for transmission, and actual dissemination of messages. We end
        up discussing scope of infod over and over again, either when asking if infod
        publishers may publish without subscriptions, or infod publishers may support 
        the equivalent of a dpublish, etc.  So what is needed is clear statement on scope
        of infod as it relates to the infod influence on message lifetime.
        - description of item in Chicago f2f chat section 10:10:49 on 6/27  
        - action item is to add description in Ch1 of specs to hopefully clarify scope.

        There are three distinct stages in the Publishing process

	(1) Observation of the Situation and its noteworthy characteristics;

	(2) Creation of the NotificationMessage artifact that captures the
	    noteworthy characteristics of the Situation; and

	(3) Distribution of copies of the NotificationMessage to zero or more
  	    interested parties.

	Stages (1) and (2) happen largely outside of the scope of the
	WS-Notification architecture; WSN does not restrict the means by which
	these stages must occur. WSN refers to an entity that performs stages 1 and
	2 as a Publisher

	INFOD enables subscribers to influence (1) and (2) by
	explicitly permitting subscribers to refer to predefined or
	application defined situations and to cause the publisher to
	execute processes (usually pre-installed) that issue messages
	that correspond to the subscribers requirements

        A publisher is an entity that creates messages. There are
        three stages involved in the creation of a messages before it
        is distributed to consumers

           * detection of an event of interest

	   * Creation of an appropriate message

	   * making that message ready for distribution

        The publisher may control the first two stages or, if it is a
        web service, it may allow other entities (subscribers) to
        specify at run time what an event is and what messages to
        create. These advanced capabilities are specific to InfoD and
        provide more fine-grained control on what gets published, in a
        dynamic way.

	For stage three, the publisher either

	   * takes on the duty of distributing messages to relevant
             consumers. In this case stages 2 and 3 are the same. or

	   * pushes those messages to a Disseminator (this is stage 3)
             that will distribute them to relevant consumers on its
             behalf.

	A publisher that also distributes messages, may obtain the
	list of consumers through an out of band mechanism or by
	querying the InfoDregistry. If the publisher wishes to be
	discovered by potential subscribers it must register itself in
	the InfoDregistry. If it wishes to be notified about changes
	to relevant consumers and subscribers, it needs to be a web
	services and subscribe for notifications with the
	InfoDregistry.

4       Should a publication "do" anything?

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything.

6       How do we relate to OGSA profiles?

        The problem is the use of WSN - which is currently mandated -
        the base one only. If we want to be compliant we need to
        refactor around base notifications now.

9       How does the registry decide who can delete the publication_types and other objects?

7       How are registry object updates  broadcast to interested infod player

        for ex, how new subscriptions are found by publishers - 
        
        describe how notifying/finding appropriate consumers for
        metadata messages - specs don't do it now (notifyUpdate
        interface half spec'ed) and we didn't discuss at F2F
        (Animation scenario feedback)

        A duplicate issue: due to the dynamic nature of publications,
        publishers, etc., a subscription may need to include
        information about how to notify consumers of changes to the
        subscription dependencies (additional publishers, removal of
        publishers that occur over time, etc.).
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/03/msg00029.html

        What is the interaction between parameters of subscription -
        their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may
        interact with each other (what happens if data filter exists
        but not association, or if both exist, or none...) -
        Describing interaction will help readers understand these
        components better and simplify section 3 as at least one is
        required but not clear what non-provided parm means (means all
        as in '*' or means NULL...).

	These are the interactions between the INFOD registry and the
	INFOD objects:

          * The objects request modifications through the
            create/alter/dropINFODResource interface In response to
            such a request the INFOD registry will identify with
	    publishers are publishing or are able to publish the
	    requested information and limit the selection using any
	    criteria that is part of the publisher and consumer
	    specification.

	  * If the INFOD registry is unable to verify the expression
	    related to the data it will request verification by at
	    least one publisher using a web services interface.

          * If requested the subscriber will be notified - using the
            consumption interface - to select publishers and subscribers of
	    interest.

          * If requested the publisher will be notified - using the
	    consumption interface - about the changes:
	    new/changed/dropped subscriptions and new/changed/dropped
	    subscribers.

        Note:

	  * If the publisher (or subscriber) has not implemented the
	    consumption interface the information will be made
	    available using the POBOX. That is associated to an INFOD
	    registry.

11      How does INFOD relate to WS-RF and WS-ResourceLifetime?

        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and
        change management of resources) is not part of the INFOD scope
        yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model,
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to
        record responsibility for the change, time when a version
        becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when
        this version is valid, etc.  Document current positioning wrt
        to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or
        align with WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA
        Basic Profile Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There is
        no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

        Now just needs writing up - merge with action 26

13	How do WS-Eventing, WS-N and INFOD relate and can we provide INFOD
	services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify

        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

14      How do we break the spec into multiple documents defining different levels of INFOD?

        decomposition of interfaces, and factoring of this specification into related specification 
        documents

        The proposed factoring is as follows, from simple to more complex scenarios:

        - Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers, allowing subscribers to subscribe 
          on behalf of 3rd party consumers
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators, but without propagation 
          requirements between disseminators (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide 
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)
        - Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and with possible propagation 
          between disseminators (delivery of the intelligent cloud of figure 2 above).

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of Requirements, and pick a few that
        are doable short term, and use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each other (ie common short term
        items from both)

        Is file replication part of INFOD, or OREP ? and if part of INFOD, part of base specs ?
        (ref: http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        Have it aligned with wsn base: have infod base, one for broker - disseminator(s)

21     How should vocabularies appear in the spec and in which levels?

       how much of the vocabulary management issue really belongs in our spec explicitly,
       instead of being considered a "meta" problem that "everyone" will have to deal
       with?

       We would like our basic specification to not rely on some vocabulary manager at
       least at the lowest level. We will pick a vocab or two and just use it.

       A  generic vocabulary management will not be part of the INFOD specification.

       The INFOD registry, however, will support elementary vocabulary
       functionality.

          * The INFOD registry will be able to determine which objects
	    support which vocabulary by comparing the vocabulary type
	    (e.g., XML, SQL) and the name of the vocabulary.

          * If a vocabulary represents an XML schema and an expression
	    is within the boundaries of XQuery, the INFOD registry
	    will be able to determine if an expression is valid.

	Additional vocabulary support has to be given by the
	publishers (and maybe) the subscribers. If an expression
	references a non-XML vocabulary, publisher will be requested
	to validate the expressions

	There will be no support for vocabulary transformation; a
	publisher will not be identified even if the publishers could
	provide information when using a transformation. This function
	will be deferred until there is a generic vocabulary support.

        Maybe we won't need this at all

26      How do operational things appear in the spec?
    
        This info that applies to INFOD resources is not specifically
        addressed in this version of the specifications.
    
        How does OGSA do active management of resources? Typically,
        the resource is expected to be queryable. We propose to use a
        MIB-style structure ("resource properties") at the
        producers/consumers/disseminators to control them. We would
        prefer not to burden the registry with this functionality.
        OGSA is currently proposing to use the OASIS
        WS-DistributedManagement for this functionality for
        hardware-style management, but it might be too low-level for
        INFOD.

        There was some discussion about what this meant. It would
        appear that stopping a service is out of scope but that
        suspending a suncsription - i.e. an operation on the registry
        contents, is in scope.

        Some questions remain:

             do we expose all (?) properties of object as resource properties ?
             do we use 1 interface (thus 1 resource properties doc)

        It was decided to distinguish between the control of the INFOD
        services, which is out of scope, and operations which those
        services support.

28      Do we need a general interface for verifying specifications against
        a vocabulary.

        This is something we had been avoiding so far - but it appears
	to be very necessary for the proper functioning of the
	registry. It might be interal to the registry, or it might be
	externalized to other infod actors.  Which should it be?

 	Concensus seems to be, at least for now, that it is internal
	to the registry.
