       Susan

       Arjun, Ronny and Dieter to work on it


97     getMetaData of the spec is too vague

       - Date: 12 Feb 2006
       - Owner: Ronny and Steve
       - Target: 11 May 2006

       - Owner: Dieter
       - Target: 11 May 2006

       They should then moved to current drafts as a working document

       - Date: 30 Mar 2006
       - Owner: Ronny
       - Target: F2F


115    Remove any reference to vocabulary versions from spec

       - Date: 27 Apr 2006
       - Owner: Ronny (and Steve should check chapter 1)
       - Target: 11 May 2006


116    Describe message body for meta-data

       - Date: 27 Apr 2006
       - Owner: Arjun and Dieter
       - Target: F2F


117    Remove explicit dependency upon SOAP in chapter 2

       our text should not say "... using the SOAP v1.1. Base Fault
       Spec", but should perhaps say "... using WS-BaseFaults". Then
       should clearly mark any SOAP stuff as "SOAP Examples".

       - Date 4 May 2006
       - Owner: Ronny
       - Target: 11 May 2006


118    Remove 2 optional association fields for property constraints of
       the association and for policy of the association.

       - Date 4 May 2006
       - Owner: Steve for Chapter 1 and Ronny for Chapter 2
       - Target: 11 May 2006


119    Execution mode "FORCE" to be redefined

       This should cause any entry in the registry referencing the
       object to be dropped. This is of course recursive. If we don't
       do this we allow an inconsistent state to be exposed. I have
       currently described it incorreclty in chapter 1 as I have only
       considered the "IF UNUSED" case.

       - Date 4 May 2006
       - Owner: Steve for Chapter 1 and Ronny for Chapter 2
       - Target: 11 May 2006

       - Target: 11 May 2006
