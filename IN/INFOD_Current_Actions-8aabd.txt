5       Go over list of questions, clarifications addressed for chapter 1 in 
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00001.html
        (ch 2 questions have an open item for them)

        Page 4, para 4: "a publication specifies..." the first part is fine
        but then you say it "makes available". I don't think a publication
        should *do* anything.

23     Provide response to document proposed by Vijay on infod suggested service modifications:

           - publication regenerate - some services can regenerate some cannot  and need to cache 
           - aspects of analyst role 
           - lifetime management 
           - and new point - Clarification: A publication can be viewed as a reaction to a query 
             however the format of the published material may need to be considered or specified 
             separately  

        See  
        https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/infod-wg/document/Info-D_Suggested_Service_Modifications/

24      Document in specs summary of issues raised in Vijay's original append - and resolutions - 
        and validate still accurate with existing infod specs: 
        - declarative vs descriptive interfaces
        - type of data/temporal/meta events defined in infod
        - consumption

        See http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00004.html
        and summarize resolutions as per:
                - http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00005.html

25     Define relationship between Infod AND DAIS
        
        - document current positioning 
        - resolve lifetime issues of INFOD objects vs DAIS sessions
        - 3rd party delivery support  
        - This should probably go into a use case

26      We will need to update spec to use WS-RF resource properties and operators. But our
        query semantics might be different than those of WSRF; so we'll have to be careful
        about how we structure the registry to allow it.

        Topics about Resource Management (naming, versioning and
        change management of resources) is not part of the INFOD scope
        yet some specific components are expected by the INFOD model,
        in particular: time of a change, a reference to an identity to
        record responsibility for the change, time when a version
        becomes valid, time when a version expires, a schedule when
        this version is valid, etc.  Document current positioning wrt
        to wsrf (a few papers were summarizing this already)

        it might mean that we end up trying to build on top of or
        align with WS-BaseNotification, because it is part of the OGSA
        Basic Profile Document current positioning wrt to wsn (ref:
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/05/msg00003.html)

        WS-ResourceLifetime is a specification that allows us to
        destroy resources. Does this have any sort of versioning? Not
        obviously - this could be used for planned updates? There is
        no scheduling component to this specification - it is about
        handling instances, not any evolutionary aspects of a service.
        We will still have to have our own creation mechanisms.

        Now just needs writing up

        However we now think that WSRF should be optional - but still
        needs writing up.

        Needs comments on section 3

35      Break the spec into multiple logical documents defining different
        levels of INFOD

        OGSA profiles mandate base WSN. To be compliant we need to
        refactor around base notifications now and provide INFOD
        services as an extension to WS-BaseNotify?

        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/08/msg00010.html
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2004/12/msg00000.html

        Questions to address include: How does WS-Eventing fit in?
        What's the difference between a disseminator and a WSN broker?
        publication and WSN topic?  Vocabulary and WSN filter? Can WSN
        send message directly to a consumer by name? Publications are
        defined by topics in WSN, how does that differ from INFOD
        mechanisms for controlling publications through vocabularies?

        One proposal was to split:

        o Information Dissemination from publishers to consumers,
          allowing subscribers to subscribe on behalf of 3rd party
          consumers

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators,
          but without propagation requirements between disseminators
          (disseminators do not talk to each other yet provide
          decoupling of publishers/subscribers/consumers interaction)

        o Information Dissemination with one or more disseminators and
          with possible propagation between disseminators (delivery of
          the "intelligent cloud"

        Another proposal from F2F was to look at the list of
        Requirements, and pick a few that are doable short term, and
        use it to drive the factoring from simple to more complex
        scenarios - and use that work to see how the 2 relate to each
        other (ie common short term items from both)

        Amount of information points to two documents (not three as
        initially thought).  First document with base functionality.
        Rest in second document.

        Moving GetMData description to base document.
