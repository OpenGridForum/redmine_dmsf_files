INFOD Unresolved Issues
=======================

This is a list of open issues. Each issue has a serial number, once it
is resolved it is moved to a companion document of resolved issues

2       What are components of the manifest section of the infod data (and metadata) 
        message?

        this is the message that is sent to the consume or notifyupdate operations.
        
        Once that is described, scenarios like rgma can decide whether they can use that
        format to publish and essentially support the PO Box at the publisher site 

        A document has been circulated

5       Do we need consumptions as well as subscriptions?

7       How are registry object updates  broadcast to interested infod player

        for ex, how new subscriptions are found by publishers - 
        
        describe how notifying/finding appropriate consumers for
        metadata messages - specs don't do it now (notifyUpdate
        interface half spec'ed) and we didn't discuss at F2F
        (Animation scenario feedback)

        A duplicate issue: due to the dynamic nature of publications,
        publishers, etc., a subscription may need to include
        information about how to notify consumers of changes to the
        subscription dependencies (additional publishers, removal of
        publishers that occur over time, etc.).
        http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/infod-wg/2005/03/msg00029.html

        What is the interaction between parameters of subscription -
        their dependencies?

        Subscription parameters are infod object components that may
        interact with each other (what happens if data filter exists
        but not association, or if both exist, or none...) -
        Describing interaction will help readers understand these
        components better and simplify section 3 as at least one is
        required but not clear what non-provided parm means (means all
        as in '*' or means NULL...).

	These are the interactions between the INFOD registry and the
	INFOD objects:

          * The objects request modifications through the
            create/alter/dropINFODResource interface In response to
            such a request the INFOD registry will identify with
	    publishers are publishing or are able to publish the
	    requested information and limit the selection using any
	    criteria that is part of the publisher and consumer
	    specification.

	  * If the INFOD registry is unable to verify the expression
	    related to the data it will request verification by at
	    least one publisher using a web services interface.

          * If requested the subscriber will be notified - using the
            consumption interface - to select publishers and subscribers of
	    interest.

          * If requested the publisher will be notified - using the
	    consumption interface - about the changes:
	    new/changed/dropped subscriptions and new/changed/dropped
	    subscribers.

        Note:

	  * If the publisher (or subscriber) has not implemented the
	    consumption interface the information will be made
	    available using the POBOX. That is associated to an INFOD
	    registry.

8	How does registry handles EPRs, especially when logical EPRs for expressions?

        logicalEPRs don't current support expressions - define how to do so - indirection

        Shailendra will contact Abdeslem and Cecile if necessary

15      Which (if any) components support transformations?

        Are they supported by consumptions?  consumption  has different  use-cases:
        replication,  fan-out with same subscription and different consumer
        transforms, different channel    options for a given consumer,

16      How do we deal with retention periods?
 
        Separation of data retention from data publishing

17      How do the propagation interface(s) differ from the consume
	interfaces and what is stored in the registry?

18      Should we be looking at other rule specifications and consolidate/align with them?

        E.g. This applies to transform definitions. Specs need to document approach taken.

        Also we are oriented towards putting things in multiple queues right now.  But the 
	consumer may not want to be able to see those queues, especially cross-VO. So we
        need a mechanism for replaying past events without the producer understanding the
        ID structure of the consumer. The consumer just wants to get the information; it
        shouldn't have to know what the underlying structure was.

23      How does INFOD relate to OREP?

        OREP includes in its charter replication specifications so positioning is necessary
        between OREP (file only ?) and INFOD.

24      How do security issues apear in the spec?

        One specific aspect is how registry decides who can delete the
        publication_types and other objects?

25      Can INFOD implement R-GMA semantics?

        - target date: After next draft 

        Not yet because of lack of POBOX


27      What's special about INFOD disseminators?

        * Retention of information
        * Querying information
        * Auditing and tracking
