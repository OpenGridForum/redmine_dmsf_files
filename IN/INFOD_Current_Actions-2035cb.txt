21      Update the charter, to reflect new schedule

        The text has been simplified. It now addresses only up to
        GGF16 but will be posted.

        This may be hard to do - Arjun
        Dieter will send a document about ref implementations


28      Produce interaction diagram to guide readers in understanding general usage

        - target date: 29 Nov 2005

        The diagram is done. There was some discussion about what
        should happen to this rather large diagram. It would be nice
        to include in the cars use case though it is rather large. If
        it is simplified it may lose its value. Steve will take a
        look.

46     Justify message structure and map to the patterns.

       This should resolve issue 2

       In addition to properties supported by most messaging systems
       such as JMS and CORBA that treat messages as lightweight
       entities consisting of a header and a body, INFOD provides
       additional features to enable message tracking and additional
       routing capabilities. For example, the message ids allow the
       messages to be uniquely attributed to the publishers and
       uniquely identify its dissemination path. The header contains
       fields used for message routing and identification; the body
       contains the application data being sent. The semantics of the
       header elements are as follows:

       - Id \226 Uniquely identifies a message and attributes it to a
       verifiable publisher.

       - Length \226 The length of the message, including manifest and
       payload.

       - Type \226 Uniquely identifies a message type, for xml message
       types this refers to xsd format of the message.

       - Correlation Id \226 Uniquely identifies a group of
       messages. For multiple nested groupings multiple correlation
       ids may be associated with the message.

       - Priority \226 A sender provided priority associated with the
       message.

       - Retry \226 The number of times the disseminator will retry to
       deliver this message. The sender specifies this parameter for
       enactment by the disseminator.

       - SenderEPR \226 End point reference to enable any routing node
       to be able to interact with the sender.

       - DestinationEPR \226 The end destination EPR where the message
       routing needs to be terminated.

       - OriginalId \226 A message may have resulted by split, merge
       or join of different messages, the original id points to the
       originating message.

       - SequenceNo \226 For ordered delivery of message in a
       correlation (as specified by CorrelationId) the sequence number
       specifies the order of consumption of message. This number does
       not mean that sequence will be observed at each stage of
       routing, but is required to be enforced at the point of
       consumption.

       - Signature \226 The encryption key for the message.

       - EncryptionAlgorithm \226 The name of the encryption
       algorithm.

       - Characterset \226 The character set for the message.

       - Form \226 single or multi-byte character set

       - OpChar \226 operational characteristics.

       - userProperty \226 A set of user defined name value pairs.

       - Flags \226 A set of property attributes for message routing.

       Patterns for dissemination

       Following are the important properties of various message deliveries

       - Ordered sequence of message delivery

       &#61607; Create a correlationId to identify a sequence.

       &#61607; Associate an incremental sequenceNo with each message.

       &#61607; End the sequence by creating new correlations.

       - Transactional message delivery

       &#61607; Create a correlationid

       &#61607; Set routing flags for transactional and guaranteed
       delivery.

       &#61607; Set retry to allow recovery while routing

       &#61607; Create nested correlationid at each stage of
       propagation in the dissemination network.

       &#61607; Set acknowledgement flag on at each step of routing.

       - Broadcast of messages

       &#61607; SetDestinationEPR to NULL

       &#61607; Retry will be ignored by disseminator.

       &#61607; Priority may be ignored by disseminator.

49     Reconsider the manifest name and to give it a name that is
       consistent with its content.

       Webster dictionary defines Manifest as ?To be the evidence off?,
       The content of the manifest reveals routing information of a
       message.

       Steve F is unhappy with this and so takes the action over 

       The agreed word is "Trail". The change needs to go into the
       Spec then it will be DONE

       Changes consist of 'Manifest' will be changed to 'Trail' in 3.9.1,
       typo in message: 'body' should be actually 'trail' and finally trail
       should be defined as an array.

52     Explore the use of the subscription interface with the registry
       manager to notify publishers and consumers of changes to the
       contents of the registry manager (e.g., changes to
       subscriptions, changes to publishers, changes to consumers) -
       in other words explore the registry manager acting as a
       publisher
