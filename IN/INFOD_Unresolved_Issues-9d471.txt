INFOD Unresolved Issues
=======================

8       How does registry handles EPRs, especially when logical EPRs for
        expressions?

        logicalEPRs don't current support expressions - define how to
        do so - indirection

23      How does INFOD relate to OREP?

        OREP includes in its charter replication specifications so positioning is necessary
        between OREP (file only ?) and INFOD.
