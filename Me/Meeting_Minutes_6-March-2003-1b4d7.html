<P>Minutes of CGS-WG Meeting at GGF7<BR>Tokyo, Japan<BR>6 March 2003<BR><BR>Carl 
Kesselman ran the meeting.<BR><BR>Draft doc has been circulating, describing job 
submission interfaces. Does not included detailed modeling of resources or 
policies.<BR><BR>Started with Andrea Westerinen's demo, showing the JSIM MOF in 
action. Andrea's presentation is
<a href="../projects/cgs-wg/document/JSIM_MOF_in_Action/en/1/JSIM_MOF_in_Action.html">here</a>.<BR>Issue 
raised by Andrea about whether Batch Service is always what is responsible for 
taking jobs off the queue. Carl says must support brokers that accept jobs, then 
send them to specific batch queues.&nbsp; We need to work more on priorities for 
job submission.<BR><BR>Ellen listed a few more issues. Heidi Neumann had 
previously proposed some PBS issues.&nbsp; Is ExecutionCandidate association in 
the right place? Carl: 2 use cases (or more). To do brokering/selection, I look 
at a bunch of different services and decide which to use, and look at policy, 
priority, etc. If I have a 100-processor job that requires a Gig of memory, no 
point to submit to a service that cannot honor that. Also, a service can 
maintain multiple queues. Maybe ExecutionCandidate should be raised up and moved 
to BatchService.&nbsp; (Moved in real-time on screen by Ellen Stokes!)</P>
<P>Heidi's other question was whether the BatchJob class should provide a 
description of the task to be executed.&nbsp; Group decision is that this is 
probably opening Pandora'a box and is out of scope.<BR><BR>Carl's use cases: 
manageability case, if something fails; discovery case; single submission case; 
brokering case. Same model should work for all.<BR><BR>Tom Roney gave a demo 
non-specific to JSIM, centered around using CIM to effectively manage 
systems.&nbsp; Some details:</P>

<P>Closing from Carl:</P>
<P>We need to move the document forward. In the interest of time, we should try 
to schedule a face to face meeting before GGF8. This should hopefully allow us 
to finalize the document for GGF8.</P>
<P>We should setup a Bugzilla database to track issues.&nbsp; Larry will do 
this.</P>
<P>We have an end of March deadline to send the JSIM schema to DMTF for the 2.8 
release, but we can change later on with implementation 
experience.<BR>&nbsp;</P></BODY>
