Public Draft should be ready by March 2007. We really have to start working on the doc and some more particpation is needed. 

We should define the shape of the document. Michel has gotten requests whether we are doing anything in the group. 

We cannot say anything on the usecases as we need to read them first. Michel,Ravi are going on vacation through first week of jan.. some work can be expected to be done

Michel : Will look at RNS spec and see how it fits with arch specified in OGSA-Data WG. 

Gavin: DMI service management is interesting..

Ravi: Start with simple data types where the transfers are represented as string with protocol handlers

Resource model will be a thing for contention from the experience of BES.. for eg: representation of faults.. WS-I representation will be targeted.
