     Requirements for the Network Measurements Response Schema

This document describes the requirements for reporting network
measurements to Grid middleware. Current projects that could use this
functionality include Internet2 [I2] and the DANTE project [DANTE].

1. Introduction

A prime requirement for reports of network measurements is a common
data model and format. Network measurements are available from a large
variety of tools and infrastructures. Different Grid sites will
naturally choose differently from among those available. Although the
actual information reported by these tools is fundamentally similar,
to compare the results from different sites Grid middleware needs a
common data model and format.

The data model and format should be expressible in an XML schema
language. The Grid middleware tools are all moving towards, or already
using, Web Services technology. The basic data format used in Web
Services is XML; thus, the measurement reports should be serializable
as XML. To easily guarantee this, the formal schema for the
measurement reports should be an XML schema language, such as W3C XML
Schema or OASIS RELAX NG. Note that this does not require that all
measurement reports actually be nested angle-bracket tags, only that
the model would allow that form of serialization.

Now we have established the need for an XML schema. The rest of this
document describes the requirements for the contents of that schema.

2. Terminology

The issuer of a report is called a "reporter", and the receiver of
that report is called a "reportee".

A "characteristic" is defined as in [HIER]: the intrinsic properties
of a portion of the network that are related to the reliability and
performance of the network.

The "subject" is the portion of the network being measured. This
corresponds to the term "network entity" in [HIER].

The "methodology" is the means of making the measurement.

3. Report contents

3.1. General requirements

Where possible and appropriate, use should be made of equivalent
schema element names and structures to those contained in the NMWG
request schema.

To allow implementations maximum flexibility in "batching" data in
reports, each network measurement report may contain, subject to restrictions
imposed by the request, any number of data samples and statistics for
any number of network "characteristics" (see 2.2) measured on any number of
network portions. This, of course, includes the simple case of one
sample for one characteristic on a single network path.

The reporter and reportee are assumed to have synchronized clocks,
e.g. by using an NTP implementation, or by direct synchronization with a
GPS time source. This assumption makes it possible to report
timestamps directly, not as relative times.

In several places below, the requirement for "extensibility" is
expressed. To allow reportees to easily recognize elements that are
extensions of the existing declared structures, the serialization
format should clearly indicate in a general way which elements are
extensions. In XML, this should be done through XML namespaces: any
element from a foreign namespace is an extensibility element, and a
processor can quickly decide how it should process the element
(e.g. ignore it) from the namespace.

3.2. Identifier

To provide correlation between request and response over
connectionless transports, and to add robustness over
connection-oriented transports, each response should carry an (opaque)
identifier. This identifier will be identical to the identifier
provided in the corresponding request.

3.3. Characteristic

One or more network characteristics must be present in a report. The
network characteristics in [HIER] should be used, and extended or
modified as necessary. All characteristics should be named according
to the DAMED-WG hierarchical naming convention [DAMED].

When more than one characteristic is being reported, the report must
clearly specify which parts of the report contents correspond with
each characteristic.

3.4. Subject

One or more subjects must be present in a report. Where possible, the
abstract model presented in [HIER] should be followed to classify and
represent the subject. The representation of the subject should be
extensible so that new network topologies or addressing schemes can be
added without rewriting the schema.

If more than one subject is present, the mapping between subjects and
the rest of the report's contents must be clearly specified.

The identifiers used for the subject, such as IP addresses or MAC
addresses, should, where possible and practical, be globally
unique. However, it is understood that for security or other
implementation reasons this may not always be possible. At a minimum,
the identifier for a given subject must be unique within a given
network report, and should be consistent across reports between the
same reporter and reportee.

3.5. Methodology

The methodology may be present in the report. If there are multiple
characteristics or subjects, or both, there may be multiple
methodologies present; in this case, the mapping between methodology
and the rest of the report contents must be clear.

If present, the methodology should specify what software or hardware
tool(s) were used to make the measurement, and what those tools'
parameters were during the measurement. When different portions of the
subject used different tools (or tool versions), the tool(s) should be
reported separately for each portion. For example, if the client and
server in an `iperf' test had different software versions, the version
information should be reported separately for each endpoint.

A pre-defined set of parameters should be formulated, based on
[PROF]. This set should be extensible with arbitrary new parameters.

3.6. Results

One or more results must be present in the report. The results are all
the measured, or "observed", (time-varying) values and associated
statistics. Each result value is associated with exactly one
combination of characteristic, subject, and methodology. These
combinations may each be associated with multiple results.

A single result must specify the time interval(s) for the observed
values, and then zero or more observed values, and zero or or more
"statistics" derived from all the observed values (not necessarily
just the subset of the observed values that were reported).

A time interval consists of one or two timestamps. If it has one
timestamp, t1, it means "ending at time t1". If it has two timestamps,
t1 and t2, the semantics are "from t1 to t2, inclusive". The time
intervals could be disjoint, as in occasional pings, or could be
continuous, as in the periodic reports from an iperf. For continuous
periodic reports, only the first time interval would need two
timestamps; successive time intervals would simply indicate the time
of the next report. Also, if practical, the smallest time interval
including all the individual result time intervals should also be
reported (assuming that it's easy for the reporter to calculate this).

Results should have a type, i.e. be a named schema structure. The
result types should follow the NM-WG CIM profile and related IPPM
documents. The schema must be extensible in this area, i.e it must
allow arbitrary result types to be included without invalidating the
report. Result types may have arbitrary complexity, although
implementation considerations discourage complex hierarchical
structures.

Statistics must also be extensible. They may or may not be
typed. Standard statistics that must be supported are min, max, mean,
median, and confidence interval.

For improved responsiveness, requestors may indicate that the data
from reports be delivered in "batches" of some size. To allow for
this, the results should always indicate whether they are the first,
middle, or last of a batch of results. A shorthand may be useful to
indicate, in the case where no batching was used, that the result is
both the first and last of the batch. For example, the possibilities
"first", "middle", "last" could be expanded to include
"only". Optionally, additional information about batch size, number of
results so far, and number of results remaining may be reported.

4. Data/metadata separation

Have at it, Martin! :-)

5. Unresolved issues

This is a list, in no particular order, of issues to which the group
has zero or more than one answer.

- Should all unrecognized extensions to the known schema
(e.g. unrecognized XML namespaces) be ignored, or should the decision
to ignore or raise an error be left up to the (reportee) implementation?
