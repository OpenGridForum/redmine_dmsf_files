== Information system ==
	
	== Main questions ==
	
	=(Basic) Requirements to prop up in front of the Grid IS/EMS: =
		(my proposals):		
		it should be distributived
		it should be error-prone, and fault-tolerant
			(if one part is out of order, the system will be still usable)
		1. it should be scalable
		it should be fast for insert and update operation
		it should be capable for complex query operation 
				-> should do it fastly as far as capable
		it should be capable agregate/integrate informations from info-fragments (from JSDL, GLUE Scheme, etc)
		
	=What should it contains (information about what): =
		(my proposals):
		Resources/Services (responsibilty of GLUE ver2, Information modell groups):
			For example:
			-list of the resources/services in the system
				type of the service (Storage, Exection service, Scheduler, )
				service contact information
				service specific attributes (CPU, disk space etc)
			
				
			-state of the resources
				-load
				-avaibilty & reability (is workfs)
		
		(My extreme  ideas)
		Data relevant information system
		Application relevant information system
			running was how succesfully in the past 
			
	= Age of the information =
		only actual informations
		(it should be create a separated logging service that is responsible for this) also historical infromations
			aggreta for perfomance
			
	= How to put the infromatios to the EMS =
		put model
		pull model
		both
