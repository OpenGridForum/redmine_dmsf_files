Develop an API specification for the submission and control of jobs to one or more Distributed Resource Management (DRM) systems. The scope of this specification is all the high level functionality which is necessary for an application to consign a job to a DRM system including common operations on jobs like termination or suspension. 

The objective is to facilitate the direct interfacing of applications to today\'s DRM systems by application\'s builders, portal builders, and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs).
