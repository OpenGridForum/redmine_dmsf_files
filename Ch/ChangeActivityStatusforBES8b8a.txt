5.1.3     ChangeActivityStatus operation
   This operation provides a way to request simple transfers between states of jobs
being processed and corresponding actions.
   Input
   ActivityStatusType OldStatus: Description of the state which the job is supposed to
be in during execution of this request. If the current state of the job is different from
the one having been given, the operation is aborted and a InvalidRequestMessageFault is 
returned. This parameter is optional.
   ActivityStatusType NewStatus: Description of the state that the job is to be put into.
     On result of this command, the job should be put into the requested state. If such a
     procedure cannot be performed immediately then the corresponding sequence is
     initiated and fault OperationWillBeAppliedEventuallyFault will be returned.
   any element may be used for providing implementation specific information needed for
     for changing status of activity. Such information should not be required unless
     requesting change to implementation specific state which is not defined in GINProfile.
     If such information is needed and is missing in request then InvalidRequestMessageFault
     is returned with proper human-readable description of problem.
   Output(s)
   ActivityStatusType NewStatus: Description of the current state of the job.
   Fault(s)
   NotAuthorizedFault: Indicates that client is not allowed to do this operation.
   InvalidActivityIdentifierFault: There is no such job/activity.
   CantApplyOperationToCurrentStateFault: Requested transition is not possible.
   InvalidRequestMessageFault: OldStatus is not same as current state of activity or 
   some other element of request has incorrect value.
