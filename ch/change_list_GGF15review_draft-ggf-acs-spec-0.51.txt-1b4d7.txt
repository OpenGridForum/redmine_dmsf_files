real entity in the AA or a reference to an external storage. An external reference would be
useful if the content file is huge in size or owned by other entity than creator. Note that
ACS is not responsible for resolving the external reference or ensuring the existence of
referenced entity through the AA lifespan, if it is described in AAD as a reference. If it is
provided in a real entity with the Create request but attached as a reference, ACS
repository will verify and retrieve (resolve) the reference at the creation of the AA instance.
If that fails, it will return a fault for the Create request.

Zip will do both while others do the former only.

I think we need not this sentence. There are many formats other than zip which do both
bundling and compression.

Different styles of the DD may be needed for deployment in other system that accepts AA
and ARI

ACS doesnÅft parse the DD, therefore the ACS is neutral to any language describing DD

This is being discussed at OGSA-EMS and has not reach consensus yet. I suggest to drop
off this diagram because the whole EMS architecture is beyond our scope. I believe the
relationship to EMS is explained later section 3.3.x..

This is confusing. I canÅft tell if you incrementing a version of a particular AAID, or
making a copy with a new AAID and creating a new version number. ( I am pretty sure it
is the former, but maybe we can clarify, since Andrew Grimshaw (OGSA) requested the
capability to create new AAÅfs from existing ones.

We should allow deletion. The result can be vague on the specification. At least, the
repository must keep the consistency of the information.

I think it helps to understand this section if "data transport" is explained prior to this
section.

I supporse the refernces are not limited to URLs. It may be EPR or any domain specific
reference.

I supporse this means to use extended transport method rather than SwA and Embedded
that are defined in ARI spec.

Attaching to SOAP message is not mandatory. SwA is one of transport methods as
described in later paragraph. The discrete files may be "embedded" into the Create
message body or transported by GridFTP or anything.
