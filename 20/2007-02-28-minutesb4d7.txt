Allen Luniewski, IBMM
Michel Drescher, Fujitsu

Monutes: Michel Drescher

1) Early discussion
-------------------
- 21 Feb 2007 notes approved without changes

2) Factory concerns
-------------------
- Allen summarises and clarifies his concerns regarding the
  definition / specification of the OGSA-DMI Factory and its
  implementability while retaining interoperability
- Michel reiterates the contents of his lates answering mail 
  (http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/ogsa-dmi-wg/2007-February/000140.html)
  and clarifies ambiguous passages
- Allen and Michel consent that negotiating a data transfer protocol is a
  crucial part of the OGSA-DMI Factory
- Allen and Michel agree that OGSA-DMI needs to define information items that
  convey specific information about supported protocols for source and sink.
  -- However, the Functional Specification does not specify the infrastructure
     or means how this information is conveyed from source and sink to the
     OGSA-DMI Factory. This is punted to the concrete binding specification 
     that defines exact formats and operatione to use for which infrastructure 
     standard (e.g. WS-ResourceTransfer,  WS-I 1.1 Base Profile, OGSA WSRF 
     Base Profile 1.0, etc)
- Allen and Michel discussed a possible means for WS-I to mandate that the 
  WS-Addressing EndpointReferences that model source and sink must include
  the supported data transfer protocols encoded in the EPR's metadata section.
- An alternative approach would be that the WS-I binding specification mandates
  support of a specific operation on the source and sink.
3) Functional Specification
---------------------------
- The functional Specification has not been discussed other than potential
  inclusion of information discussed on today's call.

3) Wrap up
----------
- No discussion.
