* Summary of Actions

   ACTION: HPC Profile WG will do first draft 
           - draft schema

      - Andrew and Dave S have volunteered to review the document

* BES 

** BES State model (cont.)

   - Examples of BES state models

   Consensus towards parallel model
   - Viewed as simpler to define piecemeal and for clients to parse
     and find the parts they can understand
   - Implementors must make sure that the 'profiles' they implement
     are orthogonal to each other

   Do need to do detailed examples of this approach as part of the
   specification.

* Container attributes review - BES v18 - Table 1 

  - language needs fixing; some are optional but still need to be
    'supported' 
  - The intention is that the types column holds XML schema types
  - Name -> Common Name (1)
  - LocalResourceNameType : string but need guidance on what the
    values are; do they include the version, spelling etc. Well known
    names defined?
    - Agreed to delete; can be done as extension
  - TotalNumberofActivities: 1; need to discuss issues surrounding
    these.
