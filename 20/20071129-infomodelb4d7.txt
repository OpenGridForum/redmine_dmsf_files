Information Model Architecture
------------------------------
In absence of Sergio, Ellen explains the proposed replacement
for figure three in the said document, with the proposal sent by
Sergio to the list this morning.

Ellen expresses her preference for the "three-bubble-diagram".

The group agrees that the UML diagram should not be discarded, but 
a proper place has to be found in the architeture document.

Action Item: Ellen to update figure 3, but not with the proposed replacement.

Ellen recommends to use Sergio's UML diagram in the same document,
for example in chapter 5 or the appendix.

Michel has been working with Sergio on modelling guidelines for how
to render the GLUE information model into a GLUE XML Schema data model.

The rendering and the guidelines are not complete yet, but the discussions
revolve around the usability in XPATH and XQuery expressions.

The group agrees that we need to schedule a 2-hour slot for the 
Information Model effort, to review the hopefully close to final version
of the document.
