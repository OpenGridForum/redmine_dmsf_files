3. Workgroup Interim meeting:

At ISI in LA (fly to LAX). Karl will send details.

4. Discussion of findServiceDataRedirection proposal.

The questions was raised, is this need to be a domain specific function or a more general function as proposed? If it is likely to be common place (2 use cases already: the registry and a distributed GRAM service). A simple URI indirection was proposed as in WSIL, but this leaves out the possibility of using the resolver services.

There seems to be a violation of encapsulation, but more elaboration on this argument is needed to the list.

It was argued that the service should be able to do the indirect service data look up on behalf of the client. This would of course be the norm where this was possible. The reason the service doesn't do the indirect search has to do with authorization - the client might be in a better position to contact the other services directly. [Dave: I believe this would be clearer through the GRAM example - any takers?]

Note that the use of findServiceDataRedirection in the Registration proposal is not actually consistent with the this proposal. See actions.

The topic was Tabled for further discussion to the list and alt later meetings.

Action Dave do registry correctly with respect to findServiceDataRedirection.

5. Discussion of Registration portType proposal.

Resolved: Dump ContentName

Proposal: Replace locator equivalence with locator uuid.

Proposal: Unregister by queryExpression, to give more flexibility.

Proposal: Add a key as an argument or have the registry return a key.

Proposal: Rather than just a key, return a Handle to a service as with subscription. This would provide lifetime management but might be to heavy.

Action Dave for second draft.

Note that the next draft will still have the status of a proposal without any resolution on specifics.

6. Discussion of Service Data Proposal

Still awaiting Service Data summary document, and we ran out of time too.
