OGSA-DMI conf call minutes
==========================

11 October 2006


Participants
============
Allen Luniewski, IBM
Michel Drescher, Fujitsu
Ann Chevernak, IBI
Alex Sim, LBL
Paolo from CERN


Early Discussion
================
* Ravi volunteered for taking notes
* Ravi requested an additional agenda item 


Initial steps (Ravi)
====================
* Ravi attended the EGEE conference last week
* Short mini-conference (Ravi, James, ...)
* Agreement on starting out with collecting use cases from current 
  production implementations
  --> AI-1011a: Michel to write a data movement use case collection for
                UNICORE
  --> AI-1011b: Gavin/Paolo to write a data movement use case collection 
                for FTS
  --> AI-1011c: Ravi to write a data movement use case collection for
                RFT
  --> AI-1011d: Alex to write a data movement use case collection for
                SRM Copy
  - In about three to four weeks these documents should be fixed
* The four use case documents will feed into the main OGSA-DMI use case 
  document
  - This process will help to identify the actors in the "big picture"


Current status
==============
* Ravi as co-chair of DMI
  - Took longer as both AD Data are stepping down in their evolvement
  - Necessary steps successfully accomplished
  - Needs finishing touches, i.e. Gridforge, Access codes hand-over etc.
  --> AI-1011e: Michel to get Ravi up to speed on necessary chair issues
* Phone conference
  - Phone conference successfully set up
  - Plan to have weekly phone conferences until the main work load has 
    been accomplished
  - After that, frequency may go down to fortnightly, monthly or even on
    user request only.
* Document status
  - The group agreed that, given the current situation, starting out with a 
    blank document is what we should do.


Replica Management
==================
* The group discussed the Replica Registration Service document Arie 
  Shoshani, LBL, has sent to the group
  - The group agrees that this document gives a good indication on two 
    important OGSA-DMI use cases:
    o Using OGSA-DMI as implementation of a Replica Copying Service
      - Inter-replica-domain data movement
      - All instances of a file/data resource are identical
    o Using OGSA-DMI across replica domain borders
      - Data resource instances are NOT identical


Next Call
