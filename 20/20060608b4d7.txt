  Apologies: Tom Maguire, Hiro Kishimoto

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* June 1 minutes approved with no changes

* Action Review:

  - Re-schedule the information model rendering discussion
  - Jay will contact Platform (Chris Smith) and Condor (Miron Livny)
    to get feedback on pros / cons of the two rendering approaches
  - Darren/Andreas will take the Modeling position paper and
    discuss it within the JSDL-WG as well

    Agreed to re-schedule the information modeling rendering
    discussion for June 19 (i.e., at the next information modeling
    discussion). Post positions to the list a few days in advance to
    allow a proper review.

* July F2F update

  Discussed and revised the agenda to accomodate members dialling in
  from Europe and members that also have to attend the (co-located)
  GGF Management Committee meeting.

  Agreed that 
  - BES will need half-a-day or more and should be earlier in the
    week.
  - Monday schedule cannot be changed
  - EMS & Data (incl. DMIS) topics should be in the morning so that
    members from Europe can also dial in

  [Revised agenda-at-a-glance (V3) sent to the list after the call.]

* EMS Scenarios review

  Updated draft sent to the list. Included EPS scenario and ACS
  scenario.

  - Agreed that using BLAST as an example of a POSIX application is
    reasonable and may offer possibilities to illustrate the use of
    other 'resource' declarations in JSDL and CDL (e.g., the BLAST
    database as a resource)

  - The ACS scenario includes operation names. Doing so is good and
    should be extended to the other services, as far as operation
    names are known. For example, EPS does not have a formal
    specification yet so an approximation is the best that can be
    done.
  - For the ACS scenario the ApplicationVersion should be added as a
    term to match on. Also some description that resource
    requirements from JSDL may also have to be matched with resource
    requirements in the Archive.

  - OGSA data scenarios include an execution and staging scenario. It
    is still in draft. Dave B requested that the EMS team review and
    comment.
  - As future work there is a question on how CDDLM should interact
    with the data services. This was raised in a previous meeting
    (F2F).

  - Once the Scenarios draft is more presentable, request that the HPC
    Profile group review the scenarios relating to them.

  - For the final version 1.0 document the "Provisioning a BES
    instance" scenario may be left out. (It is still too abstract.) It
    may be added in a later version.

  - Discussed potential future work after the scenarios are done:
    - An EMS Architecture document along the lines of the Data
      Architecture document---more detailed version of the EMS
      Capability section from OGSA Architecture. Note that this is
      already on the list of OGSA-WG deliverables for this year.
    - Interactions/re-factoring between capabilities (e.g., between
      Data and EMS)

  ACTIONS:
  - EMS team to review data staging scenario (section 5 of 
     https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.ogsa-d-wg/docman.root.working_drafts/doc13591)
  - Add sequence diagrams to the scenarios:
    - Andreas will do the "Install application" scenario (3.1)
    - Mike will do the "Install application using ACS" scenario (3.3)
    - Other volunteers welcome. (Andreas will ask Donal for the EPS
      scenario)
  - Andreas will merge draft scenarios and sequence diagrams to the
    "EMS Architecture Scenarios" document
