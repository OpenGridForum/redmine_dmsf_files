Review actions from last telecon
--------------------------------
- All done.

Requirements document status
----------------------------
- Few changes in the document itself.
- Acting entities (Defintion: an entity which invokes a certain function):
 + (Ariel) We then also need components/services which are not active. => Create list of entities,
   categorise them into groups and define which categories we are tackling and which not.
 + Q: Only "Scheduling access client" or also clients like an management one?
 + Collect further entities via mailing list.
- Look at the OGSA EMS OGSA™ EMS Architecture Scenarios Version 1.0 (draft 008) document and 
  compare it to the GSA-RG approach. Q (Nicola): Is 
  the GSA-RG approach more general? A (Ramin): Yes, it may be also possible that there are GSA
  architectures which are not compliant to EMS. E.g. a Scheduling Instance is not part of the 
  EMS, this may be potential input to EMS.
- => Take EMS into account when specifiying the interactions between GSA entities and write a comparison.

Requirements template changes
-----------------------------
- Comments from the previous telecon have been incorporated. Looks very good.
- => Copy template into requirements doc to be filled in.
