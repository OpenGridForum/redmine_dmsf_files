There was no clear    statement whether they would support Macs in the (near) future.    Another alternative (Centra) was mentioned:        http://www.saba.com/centra-saba/    The consensus view was this is currently a low-priority item, but    might be useful in the future.  Document storage:     Proposal: that we make document releases (suitably packaged) and              that these release are made available using the "file              release" section of GridForge.        Noted that the file-release section in GridForge is under    utilised.    There are lots of documents in OGSA.  If someone doesn't have an    explicit reference to the document they are interested in, it is    easy to get lost.    A further advantage of making documents available through file    releases is that the issue tracker can be used against document    releases.    Question: does the document exist in multiple locations?  We would    need to be careful that released documents don't change over time.    There is a feature for locking releases.    Also, there is the concept of a "document version" which    auto-increments.  There is also a "latest document".  Normally,    this updates automatically to match the document with the greatest    document version but this behaviour is adjustable.    The consensus was to use file releases and issue tracker to make documents    available and to track issues with documents.4) Wrap up:----------  AOB: none  DTNM:    2006-10-25  17:00--18:00 UTC    Other timezones are available at http://tinyurl.com/y5ou6uOutstanding Action Items:------------------------AI-10.11.a: Michel to write a data transfer use case collection for UNICOREAI-10.11.b: Gavin/Paolo to write a data transfer use case collection for FTSAI-10.11.c: Ravi to write a data transfer use case collection for RFTAI-10.11.d: Alex to write a data transfer use case collection for SRM CopyAI-10.11.e: Michel to get Ravi up to speed on necessary chair issuesAI-10.18.a: Michel to contact Andreas to ask how to configure a Google calendar.AI-10.18.b: Ravi to undertake necessary steps to get a public Google calendar.
