1) Minutes approval
-------------------
- Jul 17 minutes approved without changes

2) Simple Information Services strawman portType
------------------------------------------------
- Two camps favoring different architecture (e.g. WS/XML style or database style)
- Very simple strawman
- Information Services are considered a bag of things
- Hiro: How are attributes specified to select the desired information?
	-- Andrew: That would be part of the XML Query that is contained (as untyped string) in the request message
- The strawman is not supposed not to be pressed on anybody. It should be treated as a focal point to concentrate on aligning the mental pictures
- What is the relation to information dissemination services?
- What is the relation to event/notification mechanisms?
- Those use cases might be best suited being modeled in separate port types
- But what about information federation?
	-- Recursive queries?
- Federation should be implementation detail
- What metadata, e.g. scope does the provided information cover?
- Information guarantee? How “stale” is this information? 
	-- Services must advertise, “What is it?”
	-- Services must provide, “How accurate/recent is this information?”
- What should be the search criteria?
- How should the information being returned?
- How to handle the query result size? Potentially tens of Gigabytes clearly do not fit into an XML message
	-- Does this affect the query language? E.g. by allowing to specify a size threshold for the response?
- How about ordering languages?
	-- Maybe looking at the solutions of RSS for ordering criteria may help here
- HPCB Filters are defined as primitive queries on pre-defined attributes
- What types of queries do we want to support?
	-- If we find a common set of typical queries that can be modeled fairly easily, can this lead to not use a powerful generic query language?
- What are typical queries issued in EGEE information services?
	-- Anything that can be represented in GLUE is stored in EGEE IS and also queried
- Is what DMTF’s CMDBf WG doing worth investigating to solve our problem?
	-- Action Item: Michel to review and summarize the effort undertaken in CMDBf for the OGSA IS problem space
- Current strawman is a passive (i.e. pull) interface – it needs to be opened up to active (i.e. event/notification) interaction too.
	-- AI Andrew: Incorporate support for “active” interface

3) Generic query interface
--------------------------
- The interface features the notion of “dialects”
- The dialects depend on the availability of alternative renderings of the same information into the different dialects
- Example dialects are LDAP, OSG, ClassAd, etc.
- One interface is the same, but part of the query is the dialect, and the real query is given in that dialect
- The interface architecture features plug-ins for translators into the favorite dialect

4) Any other business
