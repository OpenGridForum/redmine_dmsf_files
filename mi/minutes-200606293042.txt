  Minutes: Andreas Savva    

* June 22 minutes approved with no changes
* June 26 minutes approved with no changes

* Action review

  - Hiro to confirm contact with (ex-)EGA TC
    - Explained action background: look into holding a session to
      investigate how the EGA reference model fits with OGSA now that
      GGF and EGA have merged. 
    - This would also be interesting for the Roadmap

  - Add sequence diagrams to the scenarios: (postpone until June 29)
    - Andreas will do the "Install application" scenario (3.1)
    - Mike will do the "Install application using ACS" scenario (3.3)
    - Other volunteers welcome. (Andreas will ask Donal for the EPS
      scenario)
    - Andreas has started doing the sequence diagrams in RSM
    - Darren volunteered to help out
    - Review again at the next EMS call (June 29)
  - Andreas will merge draft scenarios and sequence diagrams to the
    "EMS Architecture Scenarios" document (postpone until June 29)

    - Both of these actions are in progress and their status reviewed
      during this call. [It is ok to close both since the actions
      activities listed are part of the document preparation and are
      reviewed separately.]

  - Jay will contact Platform (Chris Smith) and Condor (Miron Livny)
    to get feedback on pros / cons of the two rendering approaches
    (postpone until June 19)

    - Waiting for Jay to get additional material
    - Waiting for Marvin's proposal

  - Darren/Andreas will take the Modeling position paper and discuss
    it within the JSDL-WG as well (postpone until June 19)

    - It was discussed on a call a few weeks ago and the group is in a
      wait-and-see state on this issue. Not clear what is new or
      better with this rendering proposal.
    - The overall activity is driven by the previous action. Closed.

* Security discussion postponed

* GGF18 sessions review

  - Groups get automatic approval if up to 2 sessions
  - Last call the proposal was for four so AD approval would be
    needed.
  - Possible F2F for the Friday. The venue is not fixed yet

  ACTION: Hiro will send out an email outlining the proposal and aim
          to confirm it on the next call

* CDL documents review

  Hiro produced and sent out new versions of the CDL documents. A few
  remaining issues were discussed.

  - Location of application binary (to deploy from) and format. Agreed
    that in general the client would not know these (but may know
    under certain circumstances). So in general
    - deployer (or perhaps developer) produces (original) CDL
    - Client produces jsdl
    - And a repository or some other internal component keeps track of
      binaries and related information
  - Permission and Owner of files.
    - The binary does not have to be owned by the user running the
      job; user just needs to be able to execute.
      - Simplest case assume that the correct permissions/ownership
        are set in the archive
      - If the desire is to show it as an example in the CDL something
        like "root.bin 755" or perhaps "blast.blast 755" or 555 is
        appropriate.
      - These are also affected by system policy.
  - pre-script 
    - Hiro has talked with Chris Smith and they have removed the
      pre-script.
    - Assume instead that the db is pre-formatted (perhaps by an
      earlier user job) and that it can be made available by
      requesting a specific filesystem be made available on the host.
    - Hiro added 'database' filesystem.

  ACTION: Hiro to ask Jun and Dejan to check the CDL documents
  ACTION: Hiro to also make any relevant updates to the Scenarios text
  ACTION: Jun/Hiro to also prepare the post-deployment BLAST CDL
          document

* EMS Scenarios review

  Andreas sent out sequence diagrams produced by RSM. It includes a
  couple of the early scenarios (Direct and Indirect Job execution)
  and the "Deploy an application" scenario. This sequence diagram is
  based fairly closely to the text reviewed in earlier calls.

  Did a walkthrough of the Deploy scenario:
  - There are too many call outs to generic Information
    Services. These should be abbreviated in this scenario and
    expanded and made more concrete in others, e.g., the ACS or EPS
    scenarios.
  - Hiro's CDL does not allow the JM to change anything (and hostname
    is part of the deployment API). Need to look into this further. In
    any case it is important to also have an example of a
    post-deployment CDL document. (See action above)
  - There is a small mismatch between what the scenario describes as
    the interaction with the deployment service and what CDDLM seems
    to expect. Need to decide whether the scenarios should show the JM
    driving the interaction with CDDLM directly or whether there is a
    deployment service that does it.

  The next steps are to do the EPS sequence and the ACS sequence.

  ACTION: Andreas will send the EMS Model exported from RSM to Darren (done)
  ACTION: Donal will sent out the link to the draft EPS document (done)
  ACTION: Andreas to upload the sequence diagrams to Gridforge.

  Andreas will also prepare a revised EMS Scenarios document for the
  next call.
