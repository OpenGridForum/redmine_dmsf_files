* December 12 minutes approved with no changes

* OGSA Profile Definition final call

  - No objections to submitting this document to the GGF Editor.

* EMS Architecture update

** RSM license
  - No update yet on who is to be the IBM representative within GGF.
  - Andreas will follow up with Hiro and Ellen but it looks unlikely
    that licenses can be obtained before the F2F.
  - Meantime people could use the 30-day free version or use their
    existing tool and convert sequence diagrams later.
  - Andreas volunteered to help convert such sequence diagrams to RSM.

** Deployment chapter breakdown review

   - Reviewed draft outline sent by Andreas to the list
   - Proposed changes is re-ordering of the sections and the
     clarification that the 'level' of the container is fixed for the
     early scenarios. Also the addition of a time estimation scenario
     and the option of the selecting the 'level' of the container
     dynamically.
   - Agreed to re-organize the chapter along these lines. It will be
     reviewed again when it is time to produce detailed sequence
     diagrams.

   - Andreas to update the document.

   - Are there scenarios for containers going on and off the network;
     perhaps because connectivity is lost?
     - Not an issue discussed in detail yet. 
     - In the sense of mobile resources, the naming abstraction may be
       usefully applied.
     - Also planning to use a resource that may be available in the
       future may be partly covered by the existing scenarios. (And
       perhaps should be made clearer in the existing list of
       scenarios.)

   - Michael volunteered to so a short write up on this issue to
     include as a note in the document.
