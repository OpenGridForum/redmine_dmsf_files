* Minutes Dec 19, 2005: Approved with no changes
* Minutes Jan 12, 2006 (ad hoc): Approved with no changes

* RSM License update

  - There is some progress. Jay is following up and will report back
    on the next call (Monday).

* WSRF BP public comment

  - One comment received: Add text explaining the need to choose a
    protocol binding profile as described in the WS-I BP 1.1.
  - Options:
    - Do nothing, leave as is.
    - Add some explanatory text.
    - Choose a binding protocol normatively.
    
    - Tom proposed that it is not appropriate to make a normative
      choice on a binding protocol. This choice was left intentionally
      open by the WS-I BP 1.1 and it seems inappropriate to make it in
      the WSRF BP. It is also not necessary to add explanatory text
      since this interaction is implied by the composition rules of
      profiles. Since the WSRF BP profile is a normative document
      explanatory text should be minimized.
    - Andreas pointed out that there is precedent for adding such text
      in the "Relationships to other Profiles" section. In fact, the
      WSRF BP section already includes some explanatory material on
      composition with a (future) Discovery profile.

    - Agreed not to make a normative choice for a binding profile and
      to add a statement emphasizing the requirement described in WS-I
      BP 1.1 "Relatioships to other profiles" section. No need to
      mention what the possible binding profiles are.

    Action: Tom to propose text on the list and discuss next call

* Basic Security Profile - Core review

   Using Hiro's and Jem's commented versions.

   - l.6: Explain better what is Core here.
   - l.31: Change WS-Resources to 'resources' (all instances)
   - l.71: Same concern as for l.6: change accordingly
   - l.71: delete 'evolving institutional'
   - l.81: Same as for l.6
   - l.81-82: "and services themselves" : delete
   - l.99-100: change to "how to bind key info ..."
   - l.101: change 'specified' to 'store'
   - l.122: Table 1 namespaces:
     - Remove prefixes not used in the body of the profile
     - Change ogsa-bsp to include word 'Core'
   - l.125-130: Consider removing "special terms" for unused
     specifications
   - l.144-150: Delete unused Conformance targets
   - l.155: Check namespace documents (GFD.58) and change accordingly
   - l.185: change 'part' to 'metadata element'
   - References: Make changes per Hiro's comments
   - Appendix C is the schema of the Appendix D mini-spec and not of
     the Profile. Move Appendix C to D.6 and replace existing text.
