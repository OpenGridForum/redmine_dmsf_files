** Topics

* SUPerG Report by Mike

 Mike reported that he attended the SUPerG (Sun Users Performance Group),
 hosted by Sun Microsystems, and made a presentation associated with ACS.
 The conference was very interesting and he could get good feedback.

 ACTION: Send memo or something about the SUPerG to the mailing list. (Mike)


* Date for F2F 

 Candidate is May 23 - 24 (2 or 1.5 days).
 Pete will confirm whether Northrop can host the F2F meeting. 

 NOTE: The proper date will be announced later from Keisuke.


* Research updates on CDDLM, security, etc.
 
 - Mike have started research on security issues but not finished the task yet. 
 - Pete read the CDDLM documents and had a few questions about their scope.
 - Sachiko also read the CDDLM documents and will report her understanding to 
  the mailing list.
 - Keisuke and Sachiko had a meeting with Naregi team. They are going to
  join the next teleconference accepting our proposal. 

 ACTION: Continue working on each research and make report.


* Issues list

 We agreed to make more specific issues list about what we should/can do. 
 For example, we need more persuasive use cases to explain the efficiency 
 and necessity of ACS.

 We are going to use the gridforge tracker to maintain the list.
 Pete will take care of the tracker items to avoid redundancy between them.

 As for Solution Installation (IUDD), we need to change our document 
 reflecting their spec, but since the activity has not started officially yet, 
 we reserve this discussion.
