  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* Summary of new actions

  ACTION: Ellen will announce document review for next Thursday on the list


* Minutes, February 7, approved with no changes.

* Document walkthrough

- A number of small changes in the text and figures per last week's review
- Section 4 updated to match the Glue example
- Section 5 minor updates to figure, added Sergio's Glue/XQUery examples, modified xpath examples
- Figure 7 seems a bit long but agreed to leave as is. It is better than putting in an Appendix and seems clear enough
- As far as possible try to get GFD numbers for the references that are expected to be published soon

* Agreed to arrange for a final document review next week in order to give time for people to review the document in advance. Final call to be arranged after that.

  ACTION: Ellen will announce document review for next Thursday on the list
