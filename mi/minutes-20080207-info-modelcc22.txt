OGSA Teleconference - 7 February 2008 - Information Model Architecture
======================================================================

* Participants

  Sergio Andreozzi
  Donal Fellows 
  Hiro Kishimoto 
  Andreas Savva 
  Ellen Stokes

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* New Action Summary

   ACTION: Add text that the "grid.xml" file is the glue example that
           is described earlier and that this is done for simplicity
           (Sergio)

* January 24 minutes approved with no changes

* Action item review

** DMTF work register review is postponed; document not ready

* Information Modeling document review

  - Draft 7 is online; update to section 4 is pending

** XQuery example (Sergio)
   
   - Sergio's document is posted against tracker artf6122 

   - Revised figure to use generic names blue/green rather than slow/fast
     - Revised VO names accordingly
     - Right side of the figure has relevant concepts from GLUE
   - Updated XML example 
   - Added XQuery code corresponding to description
     - Cannot be done in single XPath expression because XPath does
       not support joins
     - VO:GREEN should be VO:BLUE
     - 'where' clause could also be part of the 'for' clause in this
       case; just structuring for readability
     - 'xsi' namespace is not needed; could be elided for clarity

   - In practice 'doc("grid.xml")' might be a collection with
     specifying a URI in practice. Agreed that this example should be
     kept simple

   ACTION: Add text that the "grid.xml" file is the glue example that
           is described earlier and that this is done for simplicity
           (Sergio)

   - Discussed whether adding examples showing extensibility points of
     JSDL for including the XQuery expressions
     - Could be done; have been partly waiting for the glue work to
       stabilize before starting this

* Review of Hiro's comments to the list

  - Agreed to all minor typographical error corrections, e.g,
    copyright mark, service mark, etc.
  - Add OGSA Architecture and Glossary to the references
  - BES, JSDL /include/ information models
    - The text is ambigous and should also describe the relation
      between these specifications and GLUE in the information model
      architecture; and the reason they are mentioned here
  - Reference OGSA Modeling Guidelines
  - Some terminology used interchangeably, edit for consistency
  - Bubble diagram: define words at the top of the figure
    - Use capitalization / bold font in later sections to show these
      are defined words
  - p.6 remove 'instance' from section name of 4.1
  - p.7 advertised resource capabilities
  - Editorial: need to make section headers and definitions consistent

  - Ellen will make the relevant changes in the next draft

* Next call is next Thursday (2/14)
  - Perhaps a short call to check up on progress and check things are
    on track

* Scheduled another call tentatively in two weeks time (Feb.21)
