  - AI-0402b
  - AI-0402c

* Roadmap - Review of Appendix B 

  - l.862: why just 'http' and not 'SOAP' or 'SOAP/http'?
    - Probably SOAP is better
    - The OGSA Architecture document has similar text and it probably
      just says 'SOAP' (needs checking)

            and make it consistent through the document

  - l.869: Agreed to move the WS-I Profile sentence to the end of the
    paragraph

  - l.874: Agreed to delete the CIM text as it does not fit in the
    specific Web services context

  - l.877 : Modify sentence to clarify that Web services
    specifications are not published by OGF; their combination is
    published "as OGF Profiles"

  - l.879 : Change 'standards' to 'specifications'

  - Figure review
    - Formatted caption as title capitalizaiton
    - Discussed coloring scheme (it encodes the standards organization
      developing the spec) and whether to also have the type of
      specification encoded in the color
      - Colors might not be visible under all circumstances, e.g.,
        after conversion to pdf
  - Agreed to add a WS-N bubble separate from WSRF and move
    BaseNotification there
  - Agreed to add legend
