------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Approval of the proposed contents for section "3.2 Concepts". 
    Keisuke posted final revision on Sep. 14. (cb_r5ggf-acs-chap3.doc)
    We reached a good consensus about reference to external storage.
    As for ensuring consistency over referenced entities, we agreed that
    digest value is enough to cover the purpose and full set of XML
    signature is not required.
   Action: Keisuke, to modify the section reflecting today's discussion 
    and send it to the ml.

* Review of the proposed contents for chapter "8. Security Consideration" 
    We reviewed the latest version of Security Consideration which Pete posted
    on Sep. 19 with his comments.
   - Mike sent the copy of this section to OGSA Security people asking for
     feedback.
   - It seems good overview explanation about WS-Security, SAML and XACML.
   - Since ACS handles data dynamically provided by application producers,
     access control policies for those dynamic data, i.e. Application Contents,
     should be provided together with AA information. OGSA Security Profile 
     does not address details of policy description language. We agreed that
     XACML is the first candidate for describing access control policy but
     other language should be allowed up to implementation of ACS.
    Action: Mike, to change the sentence "MUST be XACML compliant" to 
     "RECOMMENDED". (Done Sep. 19) 

* Review of the proposed contents for section "3.1.6 version control"
    Pete's question is whether "updating AA" means incrementing a 
    existing AA or creating new AA from existing one.
    The answer is the latter. By updating AA, the new AA instance is created
    based on the existing one. And the newly created AA instance and base
    AA have bidirectional references so that ACS users can traverse 
    the AA change histories. The base AA (old version of AA) can be 
    retrieved unless it is explicitly deleted. 
    This is also related to the ARI (chap 5). 

* Review of section "3.3 Relationhip to other activities".
    Review of section 3.3 was postponed because the contents had not yet
    posted.
   Action: Tom, Pete and Mike to write their part by next week.
      3.3.1 OASIS SDD TC - Tom
      3.3.2 OGSA EMS Design Team - Mike, Pete
      3.3.3 OGSA CDDLM WG - KF (Done)
      3.3.4 OGSA Data WG - Mike, Pete
      3.3.5 OASIS WSDM TC - Tom
