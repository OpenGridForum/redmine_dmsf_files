- [2-4] "CIM specific" rewrites to make relation clearer. Changes seem
  ok.
- [5,7] Is the OGSA RM design team the right contact place? Yes, for
  OGSA-WG; for modeling work within OGF the first contact should
  probably be the VP of Standards; for specific work with DMTF then
  the OGF-DMTF liaison. It's ok to go into this level of detail in the
  document.
- [6] Discussed whether interoperability is the right term. Dave S
  suggested interoperation might be more appropriate in certain
  places; interoperability in others. (Explained the difference in
  meaning in the context of OGF work: e.g., GIN is interoperation;
  while work deriving from spec testing works towards
  interoperability.) Fred will review the document and update the
  terminology accordingly.
- [16] Basic profile definition to be added to the Glossary. 
- [18] 'schema' (like profile) should be used with a modifier to make
  clea what it refers to, e.g., XML schema, CIM schema, etc 
- [29] Refers to Appendix A.
- Change to OGSA(r) from (tm) and boilerplate text
