OGSA Teleconference - 2 August 2004
===================================

* Participants

  Dave Berry (NESC)
  Hiro Kishimoto (Fujitsu)
  Andreas Savva (Fujitsu)
  Dave Snelling (Fujitsu)
  Andrea Westerinen (Cisco)

  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* GGF12 session planning

  - One outreach session and the rest for design teams. 
  - Data design team session
    - On Monday: seems to be the best place for it at the moment
  - Information session: keep separate for now and decide later if it
    should be part of the Data session  instead.
  - Design team reports session: Purpose is to share info across
    group. It is not an outreach session.
  - Fred to organize the WSDM/DMTF cross-wg session(s)

* CIM review 

  - Review of Cisco proposal for CIM v3 (and is mainly Cisco's
    perspective on the model)
  - Main aim is simplification of structure
    - All deprecated/redundant concepts are removed
    - Configuration is all under logical elements
  - Job will probably still be part of Core model
    - Or maybe part of job model (on its own) rather than part of
      another model
  - Indication/Alerts
    - Trying to align with CBE submitted in WSDM
    - CBE used 'situation' but there is some confusion on whether it
      is instanteneous or not.
      - 'situation' as part/subclass of 'Indication'
      - There was also some ambiguity in the definition of situation
        (e.g., 'connection' could be seen as either the beginning of
        or an already established connection.)
      - AI to make sure it is clarified
    - 'Query' to handle CBE's 'AnyData'
     - 'IndicationTime' reflects time it was sent (instance in time)
     - In some sense using polling (underlying infrastructure) to
       monitor. And the infrastructure might suppress things and show
       them at requested intervals
       - E.g., AlertInterval and Counter to capture how long something
         has been polling/monitoring
   - [p20]
     - SecurityIndication
     - New in 2.9; indicate attack types etc
   - [p21-23]
     - policy: condition - action rules; might be set up over time.
   - [p22] authentication
     - Combination of mechanisms (e.g., card + passwd)
   - Agreed that this proposal (v3) looks simpler than the current CIM
     model.

   - The recommendation is for OGSA to use v3.0 for now since it
     offers a more simplified view and can be used to highlight
     important things
   - If OGSA-Wg needs to look at more details then ask Andrea for
     assistance.
   - It is expected to be complete by end of this year(?)

* XML CIMCXV3
  - Classes in CIM are complex types in XML
  - Attributes
  - Also have a look at the schema generation rules in the emails to
    map MOF to XML
  - The rules were implemented and the translation was automatic.

  - Enums are integers in CIM
    - CISCO wanted to be able to put in richer information
      {nonnegative int and string)
  - Correlated array mapping was somewhat problematical
  - More general mapping? XLM to MOF: might be possible. and for
    example map annotations to facets etc.
  - Is it possible to use schema to do resource description for
    'jobs'?  Yes, it is also used for this in addition to
    configuration.
  - Purpose of schema generation algorithm
    - Still using MOF in V3 or is there a complete switch to XML?
    - Really want to use UML as normative
    - But using MOF and translating to Rose (UML)

  - Action: Andrea to send out
    - sblim (linux implementation model)
    - Part of IBM open source but not Eclipse
         

** Next steps:
    - Evaluate CIM V3
    - List requirements for resource description and job description

  - Andrea is willing to participate more actively in OGSA-WG for the
    above work.     

  - CIM used for applications? (Management Of WS)
    - Yes, expect CIM to be used there too
    - But 'application' is not just WS

* Next call (Monday): Heather Kreger's WSDM presentation
