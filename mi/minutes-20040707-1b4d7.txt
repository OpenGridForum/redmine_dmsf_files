* OGSA version 1 review

** EMS section review

   Agreed to a set of changes to fix terminology issues. Given that
   other EM authors are unavailable Chris will do a revision asap and
   send to Andreas.

** Naming review

  - Not really describing a service; it is a scheme.
  - Agree with proposed 3 layers.
  - Human oriented names may not be unique. [Though 'unique' seems to
    mean different things to people]
  - The EPR as an abstract name seems counter-intuitive. Needs
    clarification that it refers to the whole 'thing'. [That is
    unsatisfying also but agreed to leave more discussion for later.]

  - Data: naming issues are specifically for data-sets
  - The EMS section should be structured similarly
  
  Action: Hiro will send the proposed text to the list and if there are no
          disagreement include in the next draft.

* Glossary review
  
  - Add human-oriented name definition
  - Frank to look at Alain's email on 'Agreement' definition
  - Data resource/source revision
  - Job: is manageable resource.
    - Ask Fred to check glossary wrt Job (manageable resource)
      definition
    - Contrast job execution and manageability and that in OGSA it is
      the manageabililty aspect. (Andreas and talk to Fred)
  - Message: 'data expressed' does not capture the 'unit of data'
    aspect. Discussed revision: "self-contained unit of
    data... transferred between producer-consumer"
  - Metadata: remove data in data services and (information quality)
  - Name: Bill to try coming up with a definition
  - Service: revisit after the document is more stable. But for now
    change client/peer to requester    
  - Service handle: change to Resource handle

  Clarified that the editorial policy is not to include terms in the
  glossary that are defined adequately in the dictionary.
 
* Next steps
    
  - Submit the two documents together to the Editor
    - Friday US time for final version (final call)
    - Submit Saturday US time.
