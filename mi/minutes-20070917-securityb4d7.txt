- OGSA Express AuthN profiles Discussion (during artifact review):

Good discussion arose on how to normatively describe static policy
documents.  A point was raised about white-space and canonicalization
issues with normative xml documents.  These options were discussed:
- Using XML fragment/Document (as in current document)
- Using normative statements (sentences) with an XML non-normative
  example (Andreas)
- Creating an XSD in the appendix which, when used, would results in a
  valid policy xml document (Duane)

All agree that precision is important to eliminate ambiguity
(especially for a profile document).
Continue discussion as needed on e-mail.

Andreas asked about the definition of "OGSA endpoint" as it relates to
a non-OGSA endpoint.  Duane answered and showed definition in document
as it relates to the instances within a SOAP container or a resources
that is the conformant target.
