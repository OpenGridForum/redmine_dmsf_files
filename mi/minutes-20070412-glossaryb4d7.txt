* Review of Glossary posted by Jem before the call

  Discussed the following terms. The document was revised during the
  call and will be made available by Jem.

** State 

   - Current text not wrong but is unsatisfying
   - Suggestions to start off from a more classical CS definition.
   - People seem to be assuming what it is; has not been defined
   - One specific concern is that the first paragraph does not provide
     a crisp definition
   - Later paragraph on "stateless" should not refer to the service
     internals; it is a property of the interface. Agreed to delete
     altogether.
   - Revised and reached consensus on text (see updated draft)

** Resource

   - OGSA one implies 'pool'
   - Again should start off from a more general definition
   - Is a resource always stateful? No, it does not have to be in the
     general sense of this definition
   - Changed transient to dynamic
   - Revised and reached consensus on text (see updated draft)

** Service

   - Not defined by the OGSA Glossary; defined by the EGA one
   - Revised and reached consensus on text (see updated draft)

** Component 
   

* Next Steps

  Jem will upload the revised version of the document and send an
  announcement to the list
