    - Donal commented on the list. 
    - The topic will reviewed in the Data session at the next
      F2F. Closed.

* July F2F update
  
  Reviewed Hiro's proposed agenda. Accepted it with one minor change:
  - Swap GFS and Naming sessions -- Naming should come first since
    Andrew has to leave mid-afternoon Tuesday.

  'Official' Dinner:
  - Some people are leaving as early as Tuesday so the first choice is
    Monday, with Tuesday in second place.

* GGF18 - F2F on Friday 9/15 update

  - Jay has booked a room in an IBM facility within walking distance
    from the GGF18 hotel (5 blocks). 
    - It is a secure facility and attendees names have to given at
      least 48 hours in advance.
    - The room can hold 22 people and has a network connection.
  - Agreed to pick the IBM facility due to its location -- close to
    the hotel.  (Northorp Grumman location would have required a tube
    ride).

* CDDLM update

  - Jun will review and correct Hiro's CDL by the F2F session
  - The post deployment CDL can be retrieved by invoking an operation
    on 'system' (query using xpath).
    - Jun will provide the name of the operation and a simple example
      document showing executable, environment variables.
  - Hiro will make some minor changes to the sequences to incorporate
    the above data by the Thursday review.

* Basic Security Profile PC review - postponed
