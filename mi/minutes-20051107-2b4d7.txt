    - Tom will take the pen after Jem.

* EMS, CDDLM, GRAAP joint call preparation

** CDDLM discussion preparation

   Reviewed Dejan's meeting notes from October 12 in preparation for
   the next call.

   - No issue with communication between CDDLM and ACS via data
     services (option 2) but eventually details of this interaction
     should be filled in.
   - ACS does not place restrictions on the application data it
     stores. It is up to EMS(CSG) to decide what is where.
   
   Action: Hiro will talk with the RSS-WG (owners of the CSG
           spec) and ask them to outline in a memo what information
           they expect to have and where it may be coming from (ACS,
           Information Services, etc.) 
           - [And match that against what the ACS spec already
             defines.]
 
   - Estimate of deployment time
     - Agreed that sophisticated time estimation is not a
       high-priority item at the moment.
     - Defining the interface and not detailing how the estimation is
       carried out is a reasonable first step. (Estimation could be
       history based and also involve some prediction when deployment
       requests are received for the first time.)
       - Should this be a simple interface receiving a CDL fragment or
         one that unwinds a bigger CDL tree? For example, ask for
         estimates for deploying a CDL tree made of (A,B,C,D) (and
         considering deployments may be done in parallel) or ask
         separately for each A,B,C,D part?
         - Also in the more complex form what should happen if there
           is history for deploying B,C,D but not A.
     - Agreed that initially this interface may be very simple: either
       returns an estimate for whatever CDL (simple or complex) it
       receives; or "don't know"
     - Probably need a new sequence diagram to show the relative
       positioning of this service. [Need to decide when in the EMS
       Roadmap it appears.]

   - Hiro will follow up on other issues with Jay

** WS-Agreement discussion preparation

   - Not sure what the state of this work is as there has been no
     update from the volunteer team.

* Glossary 1.5 review

  - Client/Service provider/Service requestor
    - Not sure if these are really needed. The definitions look ok so
      include them for now.
  - ACID : leave as is
  - CSG: leave as is
  - Component: Jem and Andreas to discuss offline
  - Context: leave as is
  - IPC: leave as is
  - Legacy program: leave as is
  - Manageability: Refer to WSDM and WS-Manageability specs for
    consistency (Jem)
  - Management: Revised definition

  Action: Jem will update the working glossary copy and the trackers.
  Action: Andreas to check the use of the term 'use case' in the
          Architecture document.

* Naming proposal status update

  - Recap of key points from last call
  - Tom will have the written proposal (agreed on during the previous
    call) ready within the day.

* Basic Security Profile
  - Draft not ready - postponed for next week

* Teleconference schedule

** Next call

  - EMS discussion first; followed by Naming proposal review
  - UML tool review (given time)
    - Mike will send out his evaluation to the list before the call

* Next week
  - SC'05 is next week.
  - Next Monday: OGSA-AuthZ joint call. (Deliverables, charter,
    collaboration topics, etc.)
   
  Action: Takuya to invite the OGSA-AuthZ team to the call.
