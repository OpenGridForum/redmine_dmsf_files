* Background

  In the last teleconf DRMAA & Platform proposed getting something out
  of the door quickly and so focus on PE (platform's proposal) only.

  Last week's teleconf consensus was for a two phase approach
        - short term: PE (platform's existing proposal)
        - long term: generalize  (Ravi's proposal)

  Ravi: It is easier to start with a clean slate and make sure that
        legacy stuff are supported rather than starting
        with existing legacy sutff and refactoring. Wrong focus
        might lead to wrong direction.

  Andrew: Last time we decided that we had to study existing proposals
          and discuss them once again. In particular read

          - DRMAA specification
          - Platform's submission to OGSA document

  Andrew: After reading Ravi's and Ming's submission I realized that
          the two proposals are not mutually exclusive.

  No disagreement.

<whiteboard 1>

  Andrew: DRMAA provides an API to monitor, control jobs.
          It separates clients from the details of different
          platforms.

          DRMAA is not so relevant to the architecture because it is
          mainly an API. The API is also used for DRM systems, but it
          is not have strong impact OGSA.

  Andrew: We need resource model to handle DRM. Does CMM fill this niche?
  Hiro: CMM is not working resource model but management model.

  Ravi: CMM i/f might map to DRMAA i/f to operate on the DRM.

  E.g., DRM is described by CMM and under CMM there are DRMAA. CMM is
  general management model and DRMAA provide resouce model.

  Q: CMM is ws-agreement based?
  A: No. CMM covers basic manageability requirements.

     So a resource should have CMM portType and WS-Agreement portType.

  Chris: There's a control port for job/reservation/etc. Separate management
         port extends CMM's portType.

<whiteboard 2>

  Andrew: Job proxy/queueing service/data service etc in platform document.
          Interesting that it also includes data service.

  Chris: This could be something defined by DAIS, etc.

  Andrew: So CMM would wrap all of these [PE services]?

  Ravi: No. Each is a separate service. And management is different
        portType.

  Andrew: Platform already has done some kind of factoring.
          They have a couple of different services for legacy
          applications.

          Question for platform guys. Is it possible to refactor and
          add more services?

  Chris: No objection to further refactoring and to adding more
         functionalities.

         We have a lot of experience in supporting legacy apps.
         Many customers are asking platform to provide OGSI i/f.

  Andrew: We are not talking about OGSI i/f here.
  Ravi: Many people confuse OGSI and OGSA.

  Platform's goal is not OGSI compliance. 

  OGSI is just web services. There are a lot of interfaces. But they
  are not yet standardized.

  Andrew: Two comments.
          1) Clarify what ogsa architecture is
          2) Refactor platform proposal by adding services.

          Not just a straight refactoring. We want to introduce more
          functionalities.

  Ravi: Once our document is published, many people will create their
        systems based on it. It will be more difficult to change
        things later.

  Ming: I am very sceptical on an approach based on deriving new
        things from existing usecases. It may lead us in wrong
        direction.

  Andrew: I will summarize today's discussion from both sides in a
          short document and circulate it to the OGSA-WG. This
          discussion is very important. People not on this call should
          also be aware of it.

          Platform proposal is very important but I want to do more
          complete job (architecture). I think we can add things, such
          as deployment service, etc.

  ...

  Andrew: I have a document. (Uploads doc and goes through it).

  Chris & Ming: We've already done this kind of work for CFS.

  Ravi: There are many capabilities within existing products. 

        Not a stovepipe solution. Break down into services to expose
        capabilities.

  ...

  Who is apps developer?
  Ming: ISV

  Who is audience of the OGSA doc? 
  ISV is not. ISV will use high level API (e.g., DRMAA) only.

  Ravi: I disagree.
        ISV may chose high level API like DRMAA or contact scheduler
        directly.

        Composition is very important. End result is more than the set
        of components. It is very important design principle.

        Each composition might be what we used to call profile or
        view. (Might still be in OGSA doc.)

  Andrew: By next meeting, I will try to list services together
          with example composition.

  Refactor making sure that  legacy systems can also be supported.

  Andrew: All service [factories] are WS-Agreement based.
          I am not sure what CMM will provide.

  Hiro: CMM provides very basic (low) interfaces/constructs. CDDLM
        will provide higher level functionality such as deployment and
        configuration portTypes.

  Andrew: I should attend CMM teleconfs since people often give me
          conflicting information about CMM. Some people talk about
          meta-data aspects.
