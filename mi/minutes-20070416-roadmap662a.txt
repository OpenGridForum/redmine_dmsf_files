** - Document status (p30) review

   - WS-Addressing to WS-BaseNotification change status from evolving
     to institutional
     - -WS-BaseNotification 1.2 still used? probably not; Check and delete
     - WS-Addressing is interoperable? not sure

   AI-0416a: Chris J to confirm the adoption levels for the
             WS-Addressing and WSRF and WS-N specs

   - WS-Naming : is evolving institutional because it is now in public
     comment (GWD-R)

   AI-0416b: Chris J to ask andrew grimshaw for implementation status
             of WS-Naming

   - JSDL 1.1 document entry should should change (back) to 1.0
     (errata release)
     - It is published as GFD-R.P so according to GFD.59 it is now
       Institutional.
     - Some Interoperability experience. So 'X' on Implemented and '>'
       on Interoperable
    
   AI-0416c: Andreas S to update JSDL entry
 
  - RNS - is ready-to-publish in OGF pipeline so it is Institutional
    once it gets a number
   
   - IUDD reference - agreed to delete entry and also remove it from
     the ACS entry since it is not actually referenced by the spec.

   AI-0416d: Michael B to remove IUDD from text (ACS entry)
   AI-0416e: Chris J to remove IUDD from the spreadsheet

   - CIM (2.9) status to adopted
   - OGSA WSRF BP 1.0 - to institutional since it is a GFD-R.P
   - WS-I Basic Security Profile 1.0 is published so it should be -
     institutional 
     - But OGSA Basic Profile(s) reference the older version
     - Agreed to put a note that the reference is to the older version

   AI-0416f: Chris J to look into status of RSS (Donal Fellows) and
             whether it should be included in the Roadmap
