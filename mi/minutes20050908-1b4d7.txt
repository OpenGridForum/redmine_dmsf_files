* Independent of what OGSA decides the general pattern for naming is, BES should have Abstract Names as a MUST.
	- May generate log files
	- collection statistics
	- Going to need to have a join key of sorts
	- If I start up an activity on a BES container, and the container is billing this to someone else, there's going to need to be some way to match this 
	  against the accounting logs so that we can hook these things together.
	- Unanimous consent on the telecon for this.
* Darren to review and fix the diagrams this week
* Darren has the pen.
