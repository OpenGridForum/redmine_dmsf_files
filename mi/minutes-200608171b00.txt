  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* Summary of Actions

  AI-0817a: Dave Berry and Jay Unger will approach groups (GIN,
            Globus, etc) that have implemented practical grids and
            start a discussion on how they handle data:
            - how data is treated as a resource that can be scheduled
            - how transfers are modeled
            - how files are advertised
            - how applications find files (query, by knowledge,?)

  AI-0817b: Stephen Davey will do a cut down parameter sweep scenario
            focusing on the JSDL+BES+Data Transfer/Staging service

  AI-0817c: Andreas will talk with Hiro about getting a 1-2 hour slot
            on Thursday. It is important to know early next week---by
            the Monday (8/21) call.

* Aug 10 minutes - not available
* Aug 14 minutes - approved with no changes
* July F2F minutes - Roadmap - approved with no changes

* Review of Actions

  AI-0803a: Hiro to look into an option for a second EMS/Data call
            on Sep 7. Tentative; needs confirmation with likely
            participants.

            - Agreed to schedule this for Aug.31, preferably in the
              second part of the call. 
            - Data will provide updates (if any) from their F2F at the
              end of August.
           
  AI-0803c: Ellen to book the IBM facility on Thursday afternoon
            - Done.

  - Andreas and Hiro to revise the EMS scenario document
    (i.e. examples) so that proposal 2 is fulfilled
    + Andreas will merge Hiro's updates into the next draft
    - Done

  - Steve McGough & Andreas to do a mapping from the current JSDL
    elements / terminology into the new information model structure
    (Proposed split into Description and Requirements) (from July 18th
    F2F, postpone until Aug. 17)
    - By GGF18 as original discussed.

* OGSA Information Model and Data

  Ellen gave an overview of the Information Model work.

  - Slide 6 shows a middle abstract model. But it might be the case
    that different abstract model might be necessary for different
    purposes. One example in Data is where the information for
    discovery may be different than that for scheduling.
  - Implementation could be a (set of) XML document(s) or a
    database. And XQuery is supported by DBs as alternative to ODBC
    etc
  - Slide 11 shows a symmetric model. Expressing and matching between
    resource requirements and job capabilities may involve
    policy---there are many standards that may be applicable but the
    group has not worked through them yet.
  - For Data there are a number of open questions around the idea of
    different models for discovery vs scheduling. What are the
    interesting properties for Data scheduling?  What information is
    needed for modeling and at what level of abstraction?
    - Agreed that there needs to be an effort to tackle the scheduling
      issue between EMS and Data
    - Data has so far mostly focused on access rather than
      scheduling. For example, issues with data availability on the
      network, or performance characteristics are not modeled
      - What are the necessary abstractions for these? (fast data,
        available, ...?) 
    - There are a number of groups that should be consulted to get a
      better idea of current practice (GIN,Globus,etc). The impression
      is that the state of the art is
      - a metadata catalog---what is available
      - a replica catalog---abstract filename to physical location
      - choice of what to use is up to application

  AI-0817a: Dave Berry and Jay Unger will approach groups (GIN,
            Globus, etc) that have implemented practical grids and
            start a discussion on how they handle data:
            - how data is treated as a resource that can be scheduled
            - how transfers are modeled
            - how files are advertised
            - how applications find files (query, by knowledge,?)

  - The Data group is also thinking about a file metadata definition
    (something like the information retrievable from a POSIX stat())
    - CIM has existing work on files and Ellen can help out

* Common Data/EMS Scenarios

  Data has a set of scenarios describing services that interact with
  EMS. For example, the parameter sweep scenario. EMS also has some
  expectations, for example that a data staging description from a
  JSDL document will be correctly processed by some data transfer
  service---even though that service may not be described further. So
  it would be useful to have a set of common scenarions describing
  basic common activities, making sure that the overlap is checked and
  the interaction between Data and EMS services is done consistently.

  Agreed that a good first candidate scenario is simple job execution
  with data staging. In particular the combination of JSDL, BES, Data
  transfer service (DMI based?).

  AI-0817b: Stephen Davey will do a cut down parameter sweep scenario
            focusing on the JSDL+BES+Data Transfer/Staging service

  The aim is to discuss it at least within Data at the Data F2F (Aug
  28-30 @Edinburgh) and with EMS at GGF18. Since many Data members
  will be leaving on Thursday it would be good to arrange some time
  early on Thursday (OGSA F2F).
  - Confirmed that a number of people from EMS on the call (Donal,
    Andreas) will be at the F2F.

  AI-0817c: Andreas will talk with Hiro about getting a 1-2 hour slot
            on Thursday. It is important to know early next week---by
            the Monday (8/21) call.
