  - Agreed to split both claims in two as suggested by Tom/Dave's
    comment.
  - Conformance claim URI not dereferencable
    - It is a URI not a URL
  - Use URN rather than URI/L to avoid confusion
    - Following the OGF Namespaces document; will make it a comment to
      a future version of that document
  - There was one more comment from Blair but with gridforge not
    responding it was not possible to check it during the
    call. Andreas will check it later.

  ACTION: Andreas will update document and circulate among authors.
