* Action Item review

  - AI-0511c: postponed
  - AI-0611g: postponed

    Hiro will talk to IBM/HP based on that; and that there will be
    something simiar for the BSP & BP
  - AI-0712a: pending

* Profile Interoperability

** Review of the wiki page (WSRF BP)

  - First item has sample xml for request and result. It includes the
    SOAP envelope that might not be necessary but is given for
    information completeness
  - As first step try to get diagonal of Status (self vs self) filled
    in and then take it from there
  - Other implementations may also post their request/response patterns
  - Globus is upgrading to the latest version of the specs and it
    might take a bit of time
  - There is no urgent deadline; just need to keep process moving

** Basic Security Profile - Core and Secure Channel

   - Provide key information and then use it to setup a secure channel
   - Have to provide same level of description as for the WSRF BP

   The two wiki pages for Core & Secure Channel should be combined
   
** WS-Naming

  There are some challenges for testing the unambiguous profile. It is
  difficult to test 'for all time'

  - Unambiguous reference address: all information to identify
    uniqueness comes from the address field.
    - Might be difficult since people seem to be using reference
      parameters (Globus and Unicore are in the same position)

  Action: Dave S to look into getting someone from Julich to
          participate (Unicore implementation) [Done by the F2F.]

  Delete NAREGI from the list; they cannot participate

* Timeline

  - Wait until Globus comes to the OASIS spec level
  - Fill in at least two diagonal crosses

* August F2F update

   - Agreed to move the Interoperability session to Wednesday
     morning so that people from Europe can dial in.

* OGF21 update

  - Five sessions approved
  - One day F2F planned for the last day, Friday, probably at the
    Microsoft Redmond Campus
