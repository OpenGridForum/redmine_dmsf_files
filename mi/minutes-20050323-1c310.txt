GGF13 wrap-up:
==============

Discussion about the GFSG suggestion of promoting Design teams to become
working groups.

    Ian: What would be the charter of the new working groups?  Hiro: Up
    to chair. Ian: so we're proposing to creat WG's without a charter?
    Andrew: no they would have normal charters, but the process would
    be accelerated.  Hiro: Currently only two groups would go to WG's:
    Naming (had BOF) and Data.  Dave: Charter needs some work - not
    clear on milestones.

    Andrew: Some concerns with EMS becoming a WG at this stage -
    has to be tightly integrated and has ramifications for OGSA.  Jay:
    Also concerned because we might have leadership issues.  Hiro: We
    need additional people to get involved, and we can't have whole-group
    meetings as we do today.  Ian: We're rightly focused on bottom-up,
    and trying to keep the two going together.  Andrew: I think we can
    continue as a design team... Jay: I really want to see us pick the
    fruit from the next branch above the container and plough [or plow
    for US spellers] ahead with normative spec.  I think that's going to
    happen as a separate activity or in a WG.  Hiro: Should continue as
    a Design Team?  Jay: Yes, until we get a clearer signal on leadership
    or agenda.

    Hiro: DIfferent form Data Team, right?  Dave wants to promote to
    a WG becasue there are many people who want to contribute.  Jay:
    Yes, it's more an organizational issue than a technical issue -
    e.g. separate mailing list.  Dave B: Yes, that's part of it, plus
    GFSG wants to see more visibility.  Fred: If it's a WG it would
    be similar to the CMM WG, w.r.t how to connect to the OGSA group.
    Hiro: Different, because Data has a lot of active members from the
    whole Data area. Fred: Agree. Dave: Autonomy... Jay: OGSA pesters
    groups that weren't chartered by OGSA, so we'll clearly pester
    this group!

    Hiro: I'll continue to work with Dave to produce a consistent charter,
    and will talk to Ravi to get his feelings about the EMS team, and
    will give feedback to GFSG.

    Ian: Forming a WG would provide a charter for design teams that are
    currently confusing to people.

Status of GGF13 session minutes:

    Most are posted on GridForge now; remainder will be posted soon.
    Hiro: Postpone approval of minutes until next week, as they're no
    all reviwable.  Agreed.

GGF Issues?

    Jem: Dates were changed after first announcement; changes need to be
    announced much more clearly (subject of mail) so that people have a
    chance to change travel plans.  Fred: GGF14 has changed now; Hiro:
    GGF15 no longer in Boston...

    Tom: Sessions well attended, lots of thoughtful comments, etc. [All
    agreed.]  Jay: Yes, it was a watershed and it's up to us to keep
    the momentum going.

Telecon Schedule:

    Hiro: Dave Snelling has asked to make the time for Basic Profile (B/P)
    discussions earlier; more convenient for UK people. Proposal: have
    B/P work sessions 1-3pm Eastern time on Wednesdays, and continue with
    general sessions at normal time (6pm Eastern) as well.  Summarize B/P
    progress at the start of each evening session.  Hiro will not attend;
    too early for Japan time.  Tom will propose time to the mailing list.

    Hiro/Takuya: Dane Skow, Security area  co-chair - proposing to have a
    security discussion with B/P - Frank, Sam would need to be involved.
    Need to agree a date with key people.

    Profile Template: Informational document, written by Dave Snelling
    and others. Needs to be rationalized and synced with the way B/P
    is being normatively described.  Need to rectify discrepancies.
    Jay: Four more discussions should be too many; how about just
    scheduling two?  Agreed. Jay: doesn't seem as urgent as B/P.  Hiro:
    agree, but want to submit both to the Editor simultaneously.  Tom:
    Shouldn't be too much work.  Jay: Shouldn't it be part of the B/P
    discussion, rather than OGSA?  Yes, but Hiro would like to attend
    these.

    Roadmap: Hiro: Roadmap not worked on since GGF12.  Andrew: A defacto roadmap
    is beginning to emerge - we have a number of things being spawned out
    (ByteIO, RNS, WS-Naming etc.) - they have schedules, and we see a
    timeline.  INFOD is beginning to take shape.  Hiro: Yes, but it's not
    written down.  Dave: Giving a talk to the Astronomy RG, and I can only
    tell them what's happening because I participate here.  Jay: This is
    input to a roadmap being crafted by the broader standards community.
    Hiro: Yes, and for the GFSG.  Ian: Haven't moved forward because
    things seem quite fluid, and we know very little about what will
    happen next. Jay: Yes, but we could be proactive about what should
    come next.  We should take a crack at it.
    
    ACTION: Ian/Jay/Hiro/Andrew plus any other volunteers to get a first
    draft by April 13th.

    EMS: Jay: Need to make some decisions about leadership; Ravi is
    overcommitted.  Ian: Right now we have hands filled with doing basic
    stuff, and it will become clearer as other things are finished.
    Jay: Could put it in abeyance for now. Andrew: Make it a low
    priority. Hiro: OK, we'll table this one for a while.

    Resource Mgmt: Fred: Need private teleconferences since the analysis
    work will be very tedious for most; report at the OGSA f2f.  Fred will
    organize some out-of-band con-calls.

    Tom: CDDLM/OGSA relationship?  Dejan Milojicic (CDDLM co-chair) wants
    to establish a closer relationship, and would like to have a joint
    mtg with OGSA at GGF14.
    
    Tom: JISC (Joint Information Systems Council) sponsoring E-Science
    Workshop in Edinburgh April 28-29 (http://tinyurl.com/6pljw) that
    will pull in work from OGSA, CDDLM etc.  CIM is too complex for them.
    It would be good to have a presence, to be able to talk about OGSA,
    Resource Mgmt etc.  Hiro: Tom to be a liaison? Yes; but other
    possibilities.  Dave Berry?  Local, but not much background. Dave:
    Paul Anderson was involved with GridWeaver; see gridweaver.org to
    see more background.  Tom: Also a project called OGSA-config. Hiro:
    Need to keep aware of these activities.


Next F2F
========

    May 25/26 is the current proposal.  Some people prefer to make it
    earlier in the week, so Hiro will take a poll for preferred dates.

Basic Profile
=============

    Tracker 1316: Had a brief discussion at GGF13.  If we had a naming
    profile today and we had a basic profile, would you want naming
    profile to extend the basic profile?  Andrew: yes; Jay no.  Don't
    think it should be a requirement. Andrew: if you follow the naming,
    it doesn't prevent you from following B/P.  Jay: think it's best to
    let things compose.  Tom: I agree, having been through this before.
    Consensus: Compose, not extend.  Set to Resolve, Andreas to close it.

    Hiro: What's the target date for Naming Profile.  Andrew: Think it
    was to have a draft by GGF14.

    1315: We agreed to do this at GGF13, so set to Resolved.

    [Tom quickly reviewed status of a few others with no discussion.]

    Tom will try to get an update of the draft out each Friday, so that
    it can be reviewed the following week.

    Discussion around use of WS-I boilerplate text: Tom would like to be
    able to use their front matter, and put a citation that attributes it
    to WS-I.  Would prefer to be able to use if verbatim, but concerned
    about copyright; putting GGF copyright on it would violate WS-I
    copyright, as it does not provide for parts of the document being
    copyrighted by others. Hiro to ask GFSG for advice, and Tom will
    add a tracker to cover this.

Adjournment
===========

Meeting adjourned at 8:03 Eastern time.
