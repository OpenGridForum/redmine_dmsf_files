* Early Discussion

** Teleconference minutes Apr. 28, 2004: no comments, approved.

** F2F

   Action: All attendees to reply to Hiro on dinner preference asap.
   
   - Argonne Guest House
     - Non smoking rooms may be available. 
     - Recheck your reservation if you need one.

* Glossary

  - Jem posted update to glossary
  - Also "Grid Service" mail to summarize status of discussion to list
  - Chose a somewhat less controversial term ("event") this time

** Event

   - Jem has proposed definition of "event" in the glossary
     ("...significant occurrence...")

   - A lot of discussion around the WS-N choice of terminology 
     - "situation," "notification message," "notification"
     - WS-N has avoided the term "event" (overloaded) and is using
       "situation" in its place.
     - "situation" definition is similar to Jem's "event" definition
     - But "situation" definition doesn't sound right (from an english
       point of view)
       - "situation" has concept of continuity while "event" implies
         an occurrence
     - ("event notification message" is what many people typically
       mean with "event")

   Action: Jem to talk with WS-N folks and clarify usage terminology
           (propose to use event).

   - "...information about event..."
     - Define event content, e.g., a notification message?

* GGF11 session plan

  - Requests from GGF office
    - OGSA is the flagship architecture and the GGF Office would like
      to present it in more detail to people both outside and inside
      GGF.

  - OGSA (Markitecture) Picture
    - Picture (marketing vision) of what OGSA looks like
      - Capture content without going into design
      - To explain to outside people, sponsors etc
    - Also identify areas where more work needs to be done and find
      people/WGs to address them.
    
    Action: Hiro to send out mail to list and solicit comments.

  - Extended plenary sessions plan proposed by GGF Office
    - 1st session (Opening/Keynote) :
      - 60 minutes for Hiro and Ian (after CeC's speech)
    - 2nd session : 
      - OGSA Gap panel (identify topics that are not well addressed in
        the OGSA picture and what we would like to see happen to fill
        them in.)
        - Target audience: GGF community 
        - Message: Good things are happening but still need to do more
          work
        - Deadline is ASAP
          - Agreed to send our commitment to Steve Crumb soon
            - And decide content at F2F
     - In contrast to Arch I&II:
       - Arch I & II deals with what has been done
       - The Gap panel with what is needed to be done

  Action: Hiro to move Gap session after Arch I&II

  Action: Hiro to solicit people for panel
          (Dave has volunteered to be on the panel. Ian & Hiro are
          doing the opening/keynote so they shouldn't/don't have to be
          on panel.)

  - Other concerns:
    - General sessions call for 45 minute presentation on each topic
      but that may be too short to get a discussion going.
      - Detailed discussion in design sessions
    - Mention Glossary (in some session) so that people are aware of
        it, e.g., so that they can contribute.

* OGSA document (final draft) questions
  
  - Address the question of whether there is sufficient material for a
    final draft at the F2F.

  - OGSA doc should be recommendation or information track?
     - Question was raised in the Data design team
       - How can the document be a standard if it is based on
         standards that have not been defined yet.
    - Document is stronger than information track
      - Lays out architectural outline (to drive direction)
    - (Some discussion on what "recommendation track" means in GGF.)
    - Consensus that recommendation track is appropriate 
      - But we may not have sufficient material in the first draft to
        make a convincing case. Especially because a recommendation
        track document requires two independent reference
        implementations before it can become a recommendation.
    - One proposal (by Bill) to make the first version informational
      and the second recommendation.

  Action: OGSA-WG chairs should consult with Architecture Area
          directors.

  - Versioning
    - Do we create new versions of OGSA in the future?
      E.g. if more services need to be added or if flaws are found
      in the current version? 
    - Consensus is yes. If the document is accepted as standard then 
      later specifications will have different versions.

* CMM document discussion

  - CMM-WG is on track to completing their document by GGF11
  - OGSA-WG members should review section 3.2 (candidate for inclusion
    to OGSA doc)
  - Also related sections: on models (4) and gap analysis (5).

  - UDDI mentioned in the CMM document (but not in OGSA).
    - WSDM mentions it; not as a requirement but as an example.
      - (UDDI is a directory for static services. However, Grids
        are rather dynamic.)

  - Section 5.3 needs to be synced with the OGSA document (services
    etc)
  - Need WSRF update

  - WSDM is management of services; we may have to specialize to
    manage job services or data services
    - What level is this discussion, e.g., WSDM state model and is
      this appropriate for what we want to do or not. That is, will we
      have to define something else.
      - This kind of model (wsdm) is a specific facet (availability)
      - From some other entity's view the states are reflected in a
        different 'model'; e.g., the job scheduler is interested if
        this is a resource that can be scheduled, not how it can be
        managed.
    - Fig2, p10 (Functional/Manageability interfaces)
      - Job Manager (JM) is a capability
      - By analogy with "start/stop" on JM, the "submit/cancel job"
        should be "start/stop i/f" on the job not the JM
      - This kind of modelling is 'core' and we don't have it down
        yet.
    - This is a topic that should be on the F2F agenda. 
      - Unfortunately it is not clear if Heather will be able to
        attend.
   
* AOB

  - Rumors that the DMTF Utility Computing WG and OASIS WSDM TC may be
    having F2F meetings in Hawaii around the time of GGF.
  - Might require some coordination if true.

  - No calls next week --- F2F.
