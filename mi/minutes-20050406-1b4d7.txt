  Corrections: (Mark)
    - May F2F: EMS was confirmed for Monday
    - Allen's name is mispelled

* Byte IO charter

  During an earlier review it was proposed that since the OGSA Basic
  Profile 1.0 is not yet published the charter should mention that the
  WG will start work with a draft version of the Profile and move to
  the final version later on.

  To minimize synchronization work it was suggested to pick a draft
  version to work from and only when the WG's specification gets close
  to publication synchronize with a later or final version of the
  BP.

  There is no BoF ML set up yet. So it was agreed to mail a final
  draft charter to the ogsa-wg-ml and other interested parties and ask
  for comments. There is no problem with not setting up a call
  specifically to discuss the draft charter.

  Once that is done, incorporate any feedback and submit a final
  version of the charter to the AD. Since the GFSG call is on Tuesday
  it is important to get this to the AD fairly soon.

  (It was also suggested that important emails from the Byte IO WG
  should also be sent to ogsa-wg-ml as part of liaison work. Obviously
  there is no need to cross-post everything.)
  
* OGSA evolution policy statement 

  This is a new document written by Dave S for the GGF (GFSG).

  "Drawer statement": A (M.Linesch) term describing documents that may
  not be completely public (but not secret) and are used for reference
  when needed (kept in a drawer).  The intention is, however, to send
  this document out to the ogsa-wg-ml for more comments.

  OGSA is high profile especially after GGF's adoption of OGSA as a
  "flagship architecture." There are some concerns raised
  with OGSA adopting one specific approach. This document tries
  address those concerns based on the consensus of the December OGSA
  F2F.
  
  Three levels of interoperability
    - At infrastructure layer (based on WS standards)
      - (OGSA version 1.0 (aka GFD.30) definition of infrastructure
        also includes WSRF and WSDM. This definition is inconsistent
        with the definition in this document. Needs clarification.)
    - At the highest level based on GFD.30
      - (From a technical perspective it is not really meaningful to
        talk about interoperability at this level)
    - At the middle level based on profile definitions

  - Consistency between GFD.30 and profiles is mentioned but is this
    a vacuous statement at the moment?
    - Consistency is a work in progress.
    - There is a plan/desire to produce more detailed architectural
      documents per capability

  - Concerns that the way this document is written any profile can be
    ogsa so resulting in a tower of babel.

  - Is it possible that profiles can be inconsistent with each other?
    - Inconclusive discussion on the consensus of the Dec or Feb
      meeting.
    - From a technical point of view it is not meaningful to allow
      inconsistent profiles (so this statement seems to be politically
      motivated)

  - Technical vs branding issues
    - Who controls the OGSA name/brand and who can state that a
      profile is part of ogsa
    - If the OGSA 'brand' is important then it should not be 'diluted'
      by allowing anything to be OGSA.
    - E.g., is it possible to issue BP and then state that all other
      profiles should be consistent/build on top of this profile?
    - And a stronger statement could be that the higher profiles are
      unique for individual GFD.30 features/components
    - Might also need to work from top down to articulate the
      architecture further (something that could be done later)
      
  - Is there such a thing as a middle level profile (?architectural
    profile?) and what does it mean for interoperability
    - Profiles are concrete and talk about specific conformance
      targets so such a profile is not possible

  - Even though potentially this document allows for a tower of babel
    situation logistically it would be difficult to find the people to
    define the profiles/specifications currently being worked on. (So
    it seems like a small risk.)

  - Proposal for defining a process/policy by which only certain
    documents can use the OGSA name:
    - At the moment once a WG is formed it is accountable to the GFSG
      only; there is no formal mechanism for one WG to affect another
      except by individual member participation.
    - So some extra layer to allow OGSA-WG to 'control' such documents
      from other WGs would be needed.
    - The current process allows for feedback to documents during the
      public comment period and that could be the place to raise
      objections to inappropriate usage of the OGSA term.

  Action: 
    - Send the document out to the list and continue this discussion
      there. (Hiro)
    - Dave S will feedback this discussion back to the GFSG

* OGSA Profile definition (profile template) review

  - Existing issue with copyright affected text (text copied from
    WS-I basic profile):
    - Hiro has confirmed that it is not allowed to copy-paste this
      text. Even if GGF becomes a WS-I associate member, membership
      only provides early access to WS-I materials.

  Action: Delete the copyrighted text from the OGSA basic profile and
           template documents. (Dave S and Tom)
           - Reference the WS-I document instead

  - The status and adoption levels are the main contributions of the
    template document:
    - It is expected that profiles categorize specs used in this way
    - Level of adoption: for a profile it affects the transition from
      proposed recommendation to recommendation.

  Action: Make this kind of information for each referenced spec a
          required appendix for profiles and include an example in
          this document. (Dave S)

  - "Security considerations" is typically the last section in GGF
    documents.

  Action: Fix order of the "Profile type distinction" section and the
          "Security considerations" section. (Dave S)

  - Section 5.1: Should the term "informational profile" be changed to
    the more commonly used "candidate profile"
    - Dave S prefers "informational" but maybe "candidate" is already
      well established. No change for now.

  - Section 5.3:  
    - It is incorrect to include "evolving standard" as an allowed
      status here. 
    - "Published recommendation" should be "Grid recommendation"

  Action: Dave S to update the document with the above corrections

  - Section 5.2:
    - It was proposed to also delete 'Evolving standard' from this
      section. 
      - A proposed recommendation becomes a recommendation after
        implementation and an experience report so the standards it is
        based on should not be 'evolving'.
      - The downside is that a lot of referred work may be in progress
        making this requirement too restrictive
      - No decision reached. Need to revisit in order to clarify which
        'milestones' are being assumed. E.g., is it acceptable to use
        evolving specs up to submission but make sure they are updated
        before submission or not.

    - The adoption levels of section 5.2 and 5.3 should probably be
      the other way round. Dave S to correct.

  - Agreed that this document should be submitted as an information
    document by GGF14

  Action: Andreas to create a tracker for the template document

* AOB

  - Next call (Monday) is new WG status call

  - It is not clear if there is a Naming BoF list.
  - A BES BoF list seems to be setup (OGSA-BES-bof@ggf.org)
