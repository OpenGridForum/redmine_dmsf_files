BES Container Model document
- The group discusses the implications of the BES specification being delayed
  from entering Public Comment on the BES Container model document authored
  by Ellen
- Ellen wold like a nudge on Andrew to pass over his comments so that the 
  BES Container model can be finished.
- Andrew outlines the curent status of the BES document, outstanding comments
  and his expectations that the document may enter PC after the call today 
  (11 am eastern)

Semantic Grid, RDF and OWL in OGSA
- Ellen reports on her activities researching the applicability of RDF/OWL 
  and Semantics in relation ot OGSA
- Ellen considers RDF/OWL very suitable for OGSA
- However, tooling and implementation support seem not mature yet to start
  going down that route.
- Jay expresses his concerns whether RDF/OWL will still allow for the current 
  Information Model proposal to be used as devised (wrt to properties 
  advertisement and retrieveal using WSRF, WSRF etc.)
- David describes his experience with mapping resource properties to RDF 
  triplets (subject is the resource, predicate is the property QName, and 
  the object property value)
- Andrew and Dave express their support for Ellens viewpoint not to step 
  into RDF right now
  -- However, we should keep being gnostic about this for the future
- Jay expresses his concerns about the time WS standards spent maturing, i.e. 
  WS-Security, and projects RDF maturing about the next ten years
- Jay recommends the group gaining experience using the matching technology
  as devised in the current Information Model proposal
- The group discusses the details of the current Info Model proposal
  -- How to model and express dimensionality (e.g. RAM size, usage, 
     partitioning etc., or e.g. a software resource deployed everywhere but
     only 5 runtime licenses are available)
- The Information Model needs to reflect and address the triangular problem 
  space spanning resource selection, resource reservation, and resource 
  consumation in real life
- The group discusses whether to stick with the current technology selection or
  to keep discussing and research most appropriate tools and technologies
- Chris mentions that SML is pushed down the standardisation road through W3C
