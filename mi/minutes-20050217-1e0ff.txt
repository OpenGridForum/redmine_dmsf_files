   second session : detailed discussion

          - scope
          - requirements
          - collaboration to other standardization, other WGs
      - Tom will send his proposal agenda for detailed discussion.

* WGs to avoid time slot conflict to the ACS-WG session.

The sessions for the below two WG/BOF are among the important ones that we need collaborate closely and thus we should avoid time conflict. OGSA's are also important but it's hard to avoid conflict to them. We should try to keep up with OGSA remotely.

 - Basic EMS Service (*)
   (*) Identified as "OGSA - Basic Execution Service" after the call.
 - CDDLM 

* Collaboration with Solution Installation activities

 - Solution Installation is very inclusive and has broader scope than ACS.
   Since it is expected to be a universal standard for software installation, 
   ACS will follow its specification for the archive format. We should 
   cooperate with them and join their activities.
 - Solution Installation intends to describe an enterprise level 
   solution. In that sense, it goes well with ACS scope.

* Miscellaneous:

  - Tom has kindly accepted hosting phone bridges for the next call and 
    ACS-WG sessions at GGF13. - Thank you very much!!
