* Going over Agenda for F2F next week
* Last week the group discussed section 3.3
* Last week the group discussed section 3.6
* Also talked about event generation
	-- Possibly extend JSDL to allow the request for subscriptions for events
	-- Are those subscriptions first-class resources with their own EPRs
		-- Because we can extend the JSDL, the answer yes
		-- You would extend JSDL with sufficient information to allow for the creation of a subscription resource
		-- How would the client be able to get that handle back (perhaps get activity status)
			-- yes
	-- Could pass in an addendum to JSDL for post facto subscriptions
	-- Couldn't we give those sub-actions (in the JSDL) their own handles
		-- They already have them -- JSDL has the ability to give IDs to sub-activities
	-- Could we assign the sub-activities WS-Names?
	-- If these things can't stand alone, then let's not give them standalone status (like giving them a WS-Name)
	-- Let's have WS-Names for the activites, and then an additional field for the sub-activities
	-- Let's hold off on talking too much about this
	-- Let's add this to the agenda to spend 15 or 20 minutes looking at the pros and cons.
