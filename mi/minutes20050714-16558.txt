* Agenda Bashing
	- Andrew would like to have 5 minute discussion on Resource Model (at the end of the call) -- No Objections

* Review BES Draft Spec.
	- Going through changes from GGF14
		-- Important assumption about the container that there is some "local" filesystem that is visible to the entire container.
		-- The activity might use non-local storage -- it may provision it outsiide of this step.
		-- Andrew to make slight modifications to the assumptions.
		-- Agree to take comments out from section 3
		-- At GGF14 we discussed supporting multiple job description documents.  Decision was it was not worth the trouble.
		-- Profile specific faults should be specified in the profile rendering.
		-- Need an arrow on the link from Not Started to Active line.
		-- For each action, there is the first state diagram.
		-- For the activity as a whole, there is the second state model.
		-- No security stuff is considered at all.
		-- We could strip out the high level model, but then in order to determine what is going on even at a high level, would be hard.
		-- We need some state between Staging In and Running.
		-- What about adding a "Ready" state between Staging in and Running
		-- Two types of container
			--- One might need a state between Staging In and Running, another might not.
		-- What about basically using the same state diagram for execution that we used for the staging-in and staging-out actions.
		-- There are two state models -- use the second one, but replace the Running state with the state model of the first diagram.
		-- Need to expand running into the multiple states of the diagram above.
		-- Action for Chris Smith to look at CIM state model in the batch job.
		-- There is also suspend due to policy
		-- Do we need a suspend operation.
			--- put it on the job activity port type as well
		-- Any objects to taking "Authorization" out of document (out of scope) -- no objections.
		-- We got through page 7.
		
* Discuss the POSIX Batch Port Type
	- Didn't get to this

* Remind everyone that there will be a BES face as part of the OGSA face to face.
	- At GGF14 we decided to punt on the resource model
	- OGSA as a whole needs to grapple with this problem of resource model
	- There was a nice first pass at a rendering of JSDL into CIM that seems appriopriate for BES
	- Strictly speaking, we don't need a resource model in BES (the activity has already been decided)
	- We don't really have a firm thing
	- Andrew suggest
		-- Have an open meeting that people do or don't have to attend where people try to figure out if we can get CIM to fit for JSDL and BES and
		   come up with a proprosed use of CIM for that.
		-- Otherwise, afraid we'll end up with the old CORBA problem.
		-- Chris interested in praticipating in call
	- RSS should deal with this
	- BES is a quick activity to get started with jobs
	- RSS is more comphrehensive and will need to take more time
	- Is the CIM model XML-ified.
	- To cut to the chase, people in BES don't believe that BES shouldn't do this work, but it's important that it get done.
	- BES is a port type for executing a job, not scheduling it.
	- What time are the RM telecon -- Tuesday, 2PM Eastern.
