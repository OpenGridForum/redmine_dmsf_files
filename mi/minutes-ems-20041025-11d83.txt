* OGSA v1 EMS section public comment review

  [Numbers refer to an old version of the issues list. See attachement
  in

  ]

  - Andrew and Ravi had already worked through a number of the issues
    in a previous call. Andrew is preparing a revised version.
  - Started comment review from the first EMS comment to review
    revisions.
  
  - 50: "usage of service in section title is incorrect": Disagree;
        the service name describes the function it provides.

  - 51: "BLAST as only example": Agree; revised to make obvious it is
        an example of a class of apps.
 
  - 52: "non-legacy batch job": Agree that this is not a good term;
        Revised text.

  - 53: "Too many unanswered questions": Yes but further work in
        V2. (It is ok to have unanswered questions in v1 as it is an
        informative document and describes the issues.)

  - 54 & 66: Definition of "Job"

    - It needs to be made clearer that 'job' is modeled as a resource
      (ws-resource). Text needs some revision.
      - (That a 'job' may provide (or appear) as a resource to other
        entities is a separate topic.)

    -  Need to work out differences between job, job manager, job
       document etc. These are not clear and were a hot topic at
       GGF12.
    -  A lot of discussion on whether the current definition of job is
       confusing or misleading.
       - Agreement that the term 'job' is overloaded and ideally a
         different term should be used.
       - Not sure whether this should be v1 or v2 work. 

       - 'job' is not a 'workflow': The current definition is there to
         make the point that the 'job' is a terminal point; it cannot
         be decomposed further. 
       - However defining 'job' in this way goes against common usage.
         Intuitively anything submitted for execution (be it a
         workflow or 'atomic' job) is a job. Also why not allow for
         virtualization of this concept.

       - Another comment [66] highlights this difference in usage
         between the Requirements and EMS sections. The Requirements
         section talks about different types of jobs, simple or
         complex; seems to be common usage so redefining 'job'creates
         problems.
         - Note this discussion is just about the term used; it is not
           trying to restrict or redefine the functionality that the
           EMS section is describing.
        - There was a suggestion to change the 'Requirements' to talk
          about 'entities' rather than 'jobs' but that sounds
          unnatural (and 'entities' is somewhat of a last choice when
          no other appropriate term exists).

    Action: Mark & Andrew to review the document and with a view to
            finding an appropriate term that could be used to replace
             'job' as it is defined right now. And revisit.

  - 55: "JM responsibility" and "incompatible software": It is an
        example meant to highlight the JM's role in this specific use
        case. It does not (and does not need to) cover all aspects.

  - 56: "State model": Too soon to go to this level of detail. V2
        work.
        - Also note that there is no sub-unit of 'job' (in the sense
          that subunits are not manageable on their own)

  - 57: Task and job relation:
    - Historical background: The 'task' term was not used in the
      document before submission to public comment. (Ravi's hierarchy
      that showed task as a sub-units of Job is not part of the
      document.) There was a problem with the usage of the term
      'service' and it was agreed to replace 'service' with either
      'resource' (ws-resource) or 'task'.

    - Agreed that this has caused confusion. And will change or remove
      usage of 'task' in favor of another term.

   Action: Andrew and Mark to add 'task' to the list of terminology
           that needs to be checked.
  
    - Also need changes to the glossary to make it consistent with the
      proposed changes to OGSA v1.
      - For example, Ravi's definition is that executable aspect of a
        job is task.
     
   Action: Ravi to provide text for the glossary for job, task and
           other terms that may be affected by this discussion.

   - 58: "Security interactions": Agree that this is a valid comment
         but it is v2 work

   - 59: "translation, validation": a valid comment; but further
         refinement is v2 work.

   - 60: Unclear text: Agreed to minor re-write to remove
         'plug-points' (replace with 'interface') and clarify.

      - "Figure not in sync with text": Agreed that it is a valid
        comments. Decided to color the services that are covered in v1
        and add text on what is covered; indicate that other services
        will be covered in later versions (v2).

   - 61: Agreed that it is a valid comment: Rewrite text.

   - 62: Change 'them' to jobs

   - 63: Revised.

   - 64: "References...": problem is that some services do not have
         corresponding sections:
        - Add references where sections exist; say it is v2 if they do
          not.
        - Finish sentence at 'success of OGSA.'
        - "Logging etc": rephrase as an example and point out relation
          better.

    - 65:
      - Added quotes
      - Restate JSDL mention as example
      - Fig 5. is a collaboration diagram: change/revise caption. No
        need (cannot) add more information at the moment.

    - 66: See the discussion under 54. Wait for Andrew/Mark's
          recommendation.

  Action: Andrew to prepare revision based on comments; Send to
          Andreas when it is done.

* Comments from Olegario for v2

  - The comments were submitted as v2 comments. He had already
    submitted comments on v1.
  - Agreed to address these in v2 and not v1.


* Next call: 2 weeks. Hiro/Ravi to send annoucement on time/agenda.
