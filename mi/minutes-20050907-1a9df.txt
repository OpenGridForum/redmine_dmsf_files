* Approval of the proposed contents for section "3.1 Concepts". 
   Approved to merge section 3.1 contents to the draft with Mike's minor
   modification.
  Action: Mike, to send his modification of section 3.1 to the ml. (Done. Sep 8)

* Review of the proposed contents for section "3.2 Design Policy".
  - External Reference and Data Transport
   There was a discussion over external reference, i.e., whether or not
   ACS should resolve the reference, and to what extent ACS should specify
   the normative part. We also need to clarify what is the external reference.
  - EPR or WS-Name
   ACS is subjected to the OGSA Basic Profile and OGSA-Naming WG outcome
   with respect to addressing. 
  Action: Keisuke, to send proposed modification of the section 3.2.(Done. Sep 8)
  Action: All, to review the Keisuke's post and make feedback on the ml
   by the next meeting.

* Security concerns
   We had basically agreed that the ACS spec provides the way security policy
   can be supplied and maybe updated. 
   Mike has some question about relationship between implementation and
   security policy enforcement. For example, if the client can specify 
   transport level access control policy such as http or https, 
   how and where the new AA instance is created ?
   We continue this discussion on the ml.

* Schedule for drafting a specification 
   There was no comment for the proposed schedule.

* GGF15 sessions 
   Keisuke submitted two 90s as session requests. 
   http://www.ggf.org/gf/session_request/index.php?event=1&browse&order=5
   There is no problem about the session schedule.
   The detail agenda will be discussed at the following meetings.

* Wrap up, Next meeting

   Sep 19.
