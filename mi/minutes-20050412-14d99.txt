* Topics

1. F2F meeting

 Possible candidates are:
   * 2nd or 3rd week of May, except for 10 - 12.
 Waiting for Tom's input. 

2. How does the Naregi PSE on-demand compilation model fit to the
   ACS and CDDLM?

 - ACS need not discriminate what is a source code from what is a binary.
   But ACS may provide a sort of attributes to categorize and classify the 
   contents in the archive.

 - ACS's task is to provide a simple way to access files inside the archive,
   such as adding files to and retrieving files from the archive. 
   And also security mechanism to assure the correctness of the signature is 
   desired.

 - We need to keep discussion about whether ACS should support dynamic contents;
   for example, data cashing.
   Since dynamic data such as inputs/outputs of the calculation tend to be 
   huge, they may be better to be stored in a separate repository. 
   (But the original repository should have a reference to the dynamic data 
    repository.)

 - A sophisticated mechanism for access control is needed. Who own and who 
   can access the data?

 - We assume that each archive, not each file in the archive, has its own EPR. 

 - We need to examine the CDDLM scenario in conjunction with the ACS repository
   and the Naregi PSE model.

* Next Call 
  Announced later.
