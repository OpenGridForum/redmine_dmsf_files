* JSIM discussion

  (Based on the JSIM presentation by L. Flon)

  - Attracted to CIM because of its universality
  - The initial charter also included broker (super scheduler)?
    - Yes, in the sense that it can represent state of job
  - Started work at CIM 2.7-pre
  - Subsumed in CIM 2.8
  - The Base was CIM 2.7 'Job'
    - It is OS centric: job runs in OS, and made up of processes
    - No support for schedulers

** JSIM review

    - Additions to the CIM 2.7 and additions; also some things that
      will be in 2.9
    - Made a number of proposals
    - Items marked in dark red color is the result of the interaction
      - e.g. concrete collection
    - Added attributes to jobs based on information typically returned
      by batch systems/schedulers. For example:
      - jobqueue
      - batchservice (that manages a set of jobqueues)
      - batchSAP (an instance of CIM SP)
      
    - The model defines that
      - one system can have multiple batch systems.
      - one batchsystem has one or more APs & one or more jobqueues
      - a jobqueue consists of batch jobs
      - Note that processes/threads are not included because JSIM did
        not make any changes to the existing definitions.
    - batchjob, batchjobqueue will be in CIM 2.9
    - Some things are already in CIM 2.8

    - Execution requirements between ConcreteCollection and job
      - This job is restricted to execute on entities in
        ConcreteCollection (maybe a collection of processors or hosts)
      - ExecutionCandidate / ExecutionTarget between Job and System
        - Candidate to run on a System
        - Note the many-to-many association *--* that means that
          multiple systems to multiple jobs (e.g. MPI jobs)
      - Collection and ManagedElement (owning CollectionElement)
        - Who owns or controlls the group of processors in the
          collection
  - The document is to be published by GGF

** Future work
    - Rechartered and now collaborating with DAIS-WG to address
      database logical schema.
    - CIM has concept of database but it is a hardware/system oriented
      database description and not at the level of the schema, e.g.,
      table, column, views, etc

** Support and relation to other work
   - Globus has plans to integrate this work in the toolkit (JSIM
     provider). But WSRF support is a higher priority at the moment.
   - Other batch vendors?
      - No firm plans announced yet.
      - Platform has no plan at the moment. They are driven by
        customers' needs and the customers are not asking for CIM
        support yet.
   - JSDL connection? The WG looked at it and decided that there was
     no overlap since different stages of the job are
     addressed. (submission description vs queued)
   - No grid implementations but there are cim implemenations for
     'job', e.g., SMIS profile
   - To ease vendor support tooling is needed; hopefully CIM will be
     more XML friendly in the future.


** EMS relation

   - EMS approach is more general (not just batch jobs)
     - It would be interesting to attemtp a mapping and see how well
       it fits; maybe suggest changes as a result.
   - Adoption is always chicken and egg problem 
     - Need a broker that would require such information to be
       provided by scheduler, etc.

   - Converting CIM/MOF to XML
     - DMTF has done some preliminary work (can send sample XML
       rendering to interested parties)
     - Including rendering of textual CIM to XML. It is informative.
     - There is an XML rendering internally in CISCO. It is based on
       CISCO's 3.0 input, so classes are named according to CIM v3
       proposal 
     - The qualifiers are the only mapping problem. They contain a lot
       of information.

   Agreed to review the XML mapping and CIM v3 at next Monday's call
