* Action Item Review

  - AI-0611e: Hiro has contacted Dave Snelling and Paul Strong and
              they have agreed to include a description of their
              document in the Roadmap, as it is a specification of
              interest to OGSA. There is a tracker item for including
              this section. CLOSED.
  - AI-0618b: Michael B sent revised figure. CLOSED
  - AI-0618c: Issue created on the tracker. CLOSED
  - AI-0625a: Hiro has contacted Fred Maciel and Ellen Stokes. Fred
              has sent revised document. Waiting for response from
              Ellen. Ongoing.
  - AI-0625b: Chris J has sent email to the list. CLOSED

    After sending the mail to the list Chris J was asked by Marty
    Humphrey to remove the HPC Profile entry as it is not an OGSA
    spec. It was noted that the Roadmap is not restricted to OGSA
    generated specifications; it also includes specification used by
    OGSA specs (e.g., JSDL) or of interest to OGSA (Reference Model).
    There is an ongoing email discussion which has not made it to the
    list yet.
    - Created an issue on the Roadmap tracker whether to include this
      document or not.
   
* Artifact review

  - artf5850: Received RSS description, to be added to the Roadmap
  - artf5825: Add note to update WS-Naming tables since the document
              has now been published
  - art5842: Waiting for reply for Express Authentication profile and
             use cases

  - Appendix B: Reviewed the updated graphic. It looks good with a
    minor change of wording: WSRF <uses> WS-Addressing
