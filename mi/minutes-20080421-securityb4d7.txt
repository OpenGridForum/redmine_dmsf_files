** [artf6072] Security use case document handover 
   - There is no active security group at the moment that would be
     interested in this use case document. The more general problem is
     that it is difficult to get people to work on a general use case
     document that is not related to a specification they are
     developing.
   - It would be good to have a use case document for the security
     profiles, but this document discusses a broader set of use cases.
   - The GFSG does not require a use case document when publishing a
     recommendation track document
   - Doing nothing is an option but it would mean that this document
     disappears.
   - CLOSED: Duane volunteered to re-start working on security use
             case document and get it to publication shape. The plan
             is to publish this document as an OGSA-WG document.

* Public comment review for security profiles

  - List of revisions was posted by Duane shortly before the call.
    Participants have not reviewed the revisions in detail.
  - General note on process:
    - Reply to the PC forum comments (accept/reject & reason). Replies
      can be fairly brief.
    - Prepare final revision and once ready do final call on the list

** Review of Secure Addressing
  
  - Duane's email to the list describes changes to the document
  - After a short document walkthrough agreed that changes are minor
    and that they do seem to have addressed the public comments.

  ACTION: Duane will reply to the Secure Addressing public comments on
          the forum and then post a final call for the revised
          document to the list

** Review of Secure Communication 

   - Short document walkthrough and explanation of some of the more
     substantial changes:
     - Sec. 4.2.2: added timing information to policy documents
     - Sec. 7.2: added sp:signedencryptedsupportingtokens per
       WS-Policy 1.2
     - Sec. 7.3: paragraph at line 780 notes possibility of replay
       attack
     - Paragraph at line 595: Changed compliance statement to a note
       about FIPS-equivalent ciphersuites
     - Other minor nits

   - Some changes need a more detailed review but agreed that the
     review can be done as part of the final call.
