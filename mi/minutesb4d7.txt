The core of the Glue schema is the Generic Service description.  For each Service Type a specific schema will need to be defined.  Although there are links between these, they are very few and will be kept to a minimum. The ability to break the schema up and address each area independently will make the problem easier to manage. The schema only needs to be considered as a whole to ensure consistency of the model. As a result the current schema will be split into the following areas a person responsible for each area.

There was a discussion on how the Glue schema group fits in with the other OGF groups, eg. BES and the OGSA information model. The conclusion is that dialogue is needed between the different groups to converge and harmonize the models.  The Glue Schema currently represents what is used by the production Grid infrastructures.  Over time this needs to adapt to reflext the OGF standard, however, the OGF standards also needs to reflect the requirements and experience from the production Grid infrastructures.

We needs to start collecting use cases on the current Glue schema to ensure that these will still be met with Glue 2.0. Additional use cases are welcome but at the discretion of the group who will focus on the existing use cases and current problems.

Actions:
1) Migrate to the Glue Schema
2) Add the existing schema document to grid forge
3) Move the requirements the grid forge tracker
4) Set up a phone conference to discuss the next steps
