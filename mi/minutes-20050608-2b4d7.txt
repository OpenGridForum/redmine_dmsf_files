* Proposed sequence for possible ACS/CDDLM interface 

 Material:
  ACS-CDDLM-collaboration.doc
   posted by Sachiko, 08 Jun 2005, "Re: [acs-wg] proposed sequences for ..."

 The set of sequence diagrams which sachiko posted explains the very simple 
 case of ACS-CDDLM collaboration. Although there may be more complicated cases
 (ex. ACS notifies CDDLM when the Application Contents are updated),
 this will be sufficient for the starting point.

 There still remains several questions concerning CDDLM service behavior.

 In order to make the session more efficient, we are going to ask the CDDLM
 team to review these diagrams before GGF14 after received a feedback from Tom.

 Action: 
   Sachiko to send revised sequence diagrams to the ACS ml.
   All to send any comments and questions on the diagrams to the ACS ml.


* Issues List

 Action:
   Keisuke to register the issues list to the tracker. (done on 10 June)
   All to put forth a proposal for more effective use of the tracker, if any.

 entire AA is signed, how to retrieve each content from the signed archive,
 and so on.
 We agreed to make advanced discussion at the next teleconf or the following.

 Action:
