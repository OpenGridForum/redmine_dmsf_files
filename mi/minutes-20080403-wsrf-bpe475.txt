** Globus and USMT

- There is a problem of subscription. Topic expression is
  hard coded and isn't interoperate.
- USMT client cannot subscribe Globus server.
- Rachana is still working on this issue.
- Issue is how to find information from context.

- Michel explains there is a gap between info model and data model 
  about namespace
- The spec allows mix contents model thus we have randam sequence 
  of string and there is no shared structure.
- WS-notification does not define mix conents model. We need  
  some serialization rule.

- A solution for OGSA may be to define some dialect which uses only
  qname for topic expression.
- Qname looks like too strict.

- Ws-noticication recommends to use prefix form
  "prefix:local name" for data type serialization.

- Topic expression does not have a simple type format on the wire.

- At this moment Globus cannot talk to USMT except subscription.

- Vivian will try USMT -> UNICORE for subscriotion and see 
  how qname looks.

- Dave asks where Globus prefix comes from?
- Rachana answers that AXESS tooling generates it automatically.

- USMT has a WSDL problem thought Globus will fix this problem
  by hacking later today.

- Globus can talk to Genesis server everthing except subscription.

- Mark explain Genesis client can talk to GT server

- Genesis II & Globus have an xsd type issue.
- It is about ResourceProperty format issue.

- David will ping Tom and Ian again.
