* F2F Update

   Most people OK; Jem, Abdeslem and Dave Snelling can't make it.

   Hiro asked Heather for WSDM people to come to our meeting, but has
   not heard anything yet. Hiro will follow up.

   Proposal is for a 2.5 day meeting
   - Latha asks how many people might be able to make it
   - Hiro: so far 10, assume 10-15.
 
   - Is the F2F agenda fixed yet? No still tentative, so let Hiro know
     any suggestions.  Focus will be on the v2 document.

* Resource Model discussion

  - Latha: did we decide that we would have a single model, and should
    we first have a CIM representation of resources?  
  - Fred: didn't decide - we had a lot of contributions from Andrea,
    which is why there may be some bias toward CIM, but we haven't
    decided or said that in the document.
  - Would be good if we can synchronize.  
  - Hiro: to achieve the goal of sharing resources we may have to
    create a simple common model for the Grid.
  - Fred: A single model is utopian; desirable but not possible.
  - Hiro: depends on definition
  - Fred: problem is not complexity or size; it's consensus---we're
    not going to achieve consensus at this point.
  - Fred: Ch 4 of CMM discusses semantics and renderng. Rendering is
    how to put the model on the wire - e.g. XML.  MIB is
    semantic. When I talk about models, I talk about the semantics.
    Second level is how to access it. Industry didn't get consensus on
    one resource model, so WSDM is standardizing using a
    model-agnostic approach
    - For example: How do you map CIM operations and attributes to
      WS-RF, to Web services etc. - simple example, map CIM attributes
      to resource properties.
    - So CIM could be rendered onto WSDM. At the Gap Analysis session
      at GGF11, Heather said don't go through CIM, you map directly to
      WSDM.
 
  - What is our challenge in OGSA?  
    - Fred: which resource models do we need, so which will we adopt.
    - Bill: Advocating a non-prescriptive approach so that one can
      pick and choose?
    - Fred: no, hope we can be reasonably clear - use SNMP for this
      etc., and then
    - (Bill:) render through WSDM?  Fred, yes.  
    - Bill: so go through the models that are of interest, pick and
      choose strategic models
    - Fred: if we want interoperability we must pick the models, map
      to unicore or GLUE, CDL, CDDLM, JSDL, this kind of thing - they
      have resources also - they have attributes, but not operations,
      so if they've received a request, how do I map what's in the
      request to our model so that one understands the other. One more
      gotcha: if we're doing deployment - reservation, deployment &
      monitoring, so we use a resource model for each of these, we
      will need the resource models to be in sync, can map to each
      other. Not sure if the concept of identities should be common -
      e.g., are we talking about a running instance in a Java VM or
      are we talking about the whole host.
    - Hiro: JSDL and CDDLM are now creating their specs, so if we can
      propose an abstract model they can be aligned.  JSDL is defining
      a language for job description, not resource description, so if
      we can provide a model they would be happy to use ours, not
      define our own.
    - Jeffrin: I think Fred is trying to saying that if you think of
      managing manageable entities you can think of an enormous number
      of things - schedules, provisioning statements etc.---all kinds
      of things will need to be managed in OGSA, so fundamentally we
      have too many models - too many things to be managed.  In the
      case of deployment, while CDDLM could provide the CDL [the
      mechanism needs to be managed?] too many things that need to be
      managed---might be worthwhile to think in terms of not trying to
      match every model to a universal model, but saying that
      everything that needs to be managed needs a model, and think
      what needs to be done - but don't know how this can be done!
      Different layers of abstraction.
 
  - There was disagreement if it is easier to handle multiple models
    or multiple renderings of a single model.
  - Is this the only way to achieve interoperability? Is it possible
    to avoid choosing a specific model and do mappings at a higher
    level instead?

  - How well adopted is CIM?
    - There is some adoption on the systems side but not so much on
      the network side. And very little on the applications side.
  - For this reason (Jeffrin) seems more interested in mapping between
    models rather than assuming there is a single model. (It's going
    to be multiple models so) if you choose one thing above everything
    else then it becomes just another standard that nobody uses.

  A first candidate within OGSA to use CIM is EMS. But Fred is worried
  that we are talking about EMS as an example for resource modeling
  when there are no EMS people on this call.
  - Also it is not clear that OGSA has progressed enough to the
    point of being able to feed in requirements to CIM
  - CIM is complex and it is not always clear how or where to extend
    the model

  - Next step: Hiro to try to get more EMS people to join the next
    call
  - EMS Container & Job as two initial modeling topics

* Use case document public comments review

  - Process discussion: Discuss within group first, reach consensus
    and then post replies to public comment tracker

  1. "Service utilization"
    - 'platform service': This is no longer consistent with the
      current OGSA document. Perhaps the term should be changed; but
      in any case it does not sound like a major problem.
    - Perhaps add some explanation on what the template should be
      describing.

    Action: Relevant people (OGSA-WG) should review document and
            come up with a proposal on how to handle this issue.

  2. "Advance" vs "Advanced" reservation

     Discussed whether 'advanced' actually means something else (e.g.,
     complex reservation)
     
     Action: Jeffrin will review document and kick off discussion on
             whether the two terms mean different things.

    2-1. Disagree with suggestion to list requirements for general
         workflow engines

    2-2. Time to process reservation: Hiro agreed that wording is not
         very good and should be changed.  Action: Jeffrin to edit and
         Hiro to check

  3. Agreed to change 'enterpise' to 'organization' though there
     should not be a problem either way.

  4. This is a term defined by this use case. No extra explanation is
     needed.

  5. Abstract: Agreed to re-phrase. Jeffrin to do.

  6. Agreed to 
     - Fix figure captions to make consistent
     - Bibliography per section is ok, but fix inconsistent
       formatting
     - Section refs are incorrect: Search for 'section' keyword and
       make into real cross refs to the section numbers

  7. English corrections: ok.

  8. 7.2.2 service description:
     - The comment is not clear; ask for more explanation.

     - Workflow as GS: Not sure if this has to be drawn out in this
       case but adding a reference is a possibility. Need more
       information about 'taverna' and what they think its relevance
       is.

     - Collaboration: Reject. It seems inappropriate to add
       implementations.

     - Machine readability: Agree in principle but not sure what need
       to be added.

     - Collaboration: Add a sentence about 'dynamic nature' and
       'description language'

  - Other comments:
    - Jeffrin to check again who is the original author of the mutual
      authorization use case and add to contributors

    - Acknowledgment: Should 'work supported by' be kept? 
      - Confirm with relevant people first(e.g., Ian Foster)

    - Should refactor the use case document to make it consistent with
      the OGSA doc. But it is not clear how much work this will be.
