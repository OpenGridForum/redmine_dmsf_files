* CIM Tutorial (part 2): Early discussion

  - CIM Profiles
    - Hiro expected CIM Profiles would be simple and short and present
      a more consice view of the CIM model but actually they are quite
      long and seem very complex.
    - Profiles are not the place to start to understand CIM.

  - Review material using the preliminary version of CIM model 2.8

* Core specification review 

** p1 Overview of CIM model
   - Shows all the concepts that are in the model
   - ManagedElement is the basic component
   - LogicalIdentity an attempt to avoid multiple inheritance
   - SettingData & StatisticalData are new. The older
     StatisticalInformation and Setting to be removed in 3.0
   - Component and Relationship: could not change from abstract to
     concrete without breaking other stuff
     - Created versions of Component and Relationship that can be
       instantiated (superclass is abstract but can instantiate
       specific 'x')

** p2 Managed System Elements
  - Job is a LogicalElement (abstract class)
  - Concrete subclass has specific information about running job
    - E.g., Request state change of job
    - (And KillJob in abstract class is deprecated in favor of this.)
  - A way to monitor/manage a job
  - The Job class should be a superclass of anything that is a job
  - Since it has operations CIM is not just a data model. It also
    provides an operational model. (Can be thought of as an object
    model.)

** p3 Enabled Logical Elements

  - Not all LogicalElements (LEs) are EnabledLogicalElement
  - Meaning of Quiesce? 'Finish current work but do not accept more'
    - It doesn't necessarily mean 'sleep'---it is implementation
      specific
  - How are LEs named?
    - Instance ID in Cim 2.x
    - Key in 3.x ?
    - Rules to create unique names
    - Are these URNs? 
      - Vendors qualified prefix plus other value
      - These will probably end up being URNs
    - Is it part of the model how to resolve them?
      - That is more towards implementation. The model makes no
        assumptions
    - Also another open question is how to do semantic equivalence

  - All boxes defined normatively in MOFs and also discussed in white
    papers
  - AccessPoint: way to get hold of a service
  - RemoteSAP: e.g., a phone number.
  - System: an entity viewed as a whole but made up of many parts.

** p4 Physical Elements and Logical Devices

  - (Red text marks deprecated features; will be changed in CIM 3)
  - If a feature is deprecated MOF provides information on what
    deprecated for
  - PhysicalElement location existed. It was moved to the superclass
    of Element location to allow more general 'use'
  - LogicalDevice is a representation of PhysicalDevice

** p5 Collections

  - Collections can be multisets

** p6 Redundancy Group

  - It can represent any kind of redundancy information
  - It will be changed and improved in v2.9 expected at the end of
    this month
    - It can represent both a spare and extra capacity group

** p7  Product, FRU & Software Identity

  - FRU is deprecated: there are 3 different concepts: what repair
    person brings, what can be FRU, and ...
  - This will be cleaned up in v2.9

  - SoftwareIdentity should have been called SoftwareApplication but
    the name was already taken. It is expected to be cleaned in v3.x
  - ServiceRelationship off Product indicates where the product was
    bought from.

** p8 Statistics

  - Separate what is unchanging data (capabilities) from the
    information that may be rapidly changing and which might require
    monitoring
  - Statistics can be logged (message log concepts)
  - StatisticalData is raw data. It can be processed as time series
    etc.

** p9 SettingData, Profiles, Capabilities, Poer
  - p9 onwards are or will be deprecated and removed

** Other discussion

  - MOF is like IDL
    - Can it describe semantics?
    - It describes what the method is trying to accomplish in addition
      to its signature. It gives a complete description while UML
      provides an overview

    - Definition of semantics often ends up being prose
      - Qualifiers include more formal information for doublechecking
        as well
      - (Cisco uses schema regex as qualifiers e.g., ipv4, ipv6
        address is X)

* System specification review

** p1 UML

** p2 ComputerSystem
  - Deprecated PowerManagement
  - Cluster is also deprecated in 2.9 and reworked as a RedundancySet
  - ComputerSystem remains but many of its subclasses are deprecated
  - Dedicated: what it does, if it does only one thing.

  - As going down in the hierarchy need to keep in mind what has been
    defined before
    - Javadoc viewer can help in reviewing the model (Tom to look for
      it and send a link)

** p3 File Systems

  - FileSystem: reworked importing/exporting etc

** p4 Operating System
  - There is a relationship to the filesystem it booted from
  - Can describe the set of installed OS on ComputerSystem

** p5 Processing and Job Queues

  - Multiple processes may be associated with a service
  - In v3.x all dynamic properties will move to StatisticalInformation
  - What are 'keys'? It gives an 'instance' flavor
    - Any new classes in 2.7 and later have 'key' while older classes
      have more compound keys
  - There is a more 'cleaned up' version. Andrea to send to the list

** p6 Boot services
  - May be reworked in v3.x. It is more of a placeholder at this stage
      - Parts are there just to allow vendor things to be added

** p7 Time

  - How to represent time; includes daylight time switching, etc.

** p8 Unix system

** p9 System Resources
  - At the moment it is mainly hardware definitions
    - When it was defined ('96) plug and play was important
  - In v2.9 software resources will start being added, and will start
    tackling software configuration, etc.

** p10 Message Log
  - How to go through logs
  - Also association with where the log is going.

** Other discussion

  - v2.9 is expected to be released in July
  - MOF: LogicalFile
    - No operations defined; just metadata
    - People were happy using their own operational/functional model
    - Is something is not defined it is likely to be an omission
    - There is always a problem of where to draw the line on
      management

* Device review

** p1 UML
  - DeviceError became StatisticalInformation
  - 'Doors' are there to make sure that the device is in the correct
    physical state before doing some operation

** p2 Cooling & Power
  - Power to devices; associated cooling etc

** p3 Processor
** p4 Controllers
  -  No serial controller; missing line

** p5 PCI devices
** p6 Logical Ports
    - Layer 1 element in ISO stack (0 is Physical)

** p7 Group 
** p8 Protocol Controller
  - Attach/detach are more operational
    - But given certain states you might want to...
  - (State and behaviour WG relationship)
    - Different way of modelling this instead of using qualifiers

** p9 Network Adapters
   - A lot of this is deprecated
** p10 Fibre
** p11 Zoning
   - Zones are in Fabric which is instance of Network. The gist of it
     is trying to build on other aspects of model.

* Other discussion

  Note: CIM is work in progress; things may look inconsistent for
    historical reasons.
  - Considering/planning move to UML and XMI. Qualifier mapping is the
    difficulty and how to express protocol for web services
    independent of the modeling stuff.

  Action: Tom to post URL to the preliminary v2.9 to ML

  - v2.9 cleans up diagrams etc, and sets the scene for 3.x
  - Profiles are starting to kick in (will be kicking in before 3.x)
  - The most likely point of interest is in the leaf nodes; they will
    not be that changed in 3.x

  Action: Andrea will send out Cisco's cleaned up version of the CIM.

  - JSIM discusion next week
  - And cleaned up model and semantics of lower nodes in 2 weeks time

  - How to start on gap analysis between CIM and Grid(OGSA)?
    - What is the timeframe of the UC-WG and what it addresses
    - Tom to follow up and send more details
    - Link up and make sure that priorities of components match
      - UC F2F last week
      - Next is August 18, 19, 20, which are the same dates as OGSA
        (and probably in the same general area)
      - There is a desire to coordinate with OGSA
      - Tom and Hiro to coordinate
