  </font> 
<p> <font face="Verdana" size="2">1. Make sure your draft document meets the <a href="http://www.ggf.org/documents/default.htm">requirements</a> 
  for all Grid Working Drafts prior to submission. <br>
  2. Go to the <a href="https://forge.gridforum.org/docman2/AddDocument.php?group_id=90">Submit 
  document form </a>for the Editor project (please login if you have not already 
  done so).<br>
3. Browse to the document you wish to submit and select it (thus, populating the 
<strong>Upload File</strong> field). If your document is a text only document 
and you wish to paste your document into the <strong>Paste Document</strong> pane, 
then leave the <strong>Upload File</strong> field blank.<br>
4. Select the appropriate <strong>File Type</strong> (e.g., PDF) from the drop 
down (this MUST match the type of the file you are submitting).<br>
5. Fill in the <strong>Document Title</strong> and <strong>Description fields</strong>.<br>
6. If you provided a file for upload in step 3, then leave the <strong>Paste Document</strong> 
pane empty. Otherwise, paste your text-only document into the <strong>Paste Document</strong> 
pane.<br>
7. Select &quot;Public&quot; form the <strong>Access Type</strong> drop-down.<br>
8. In the <strong>Category</strong> drop-down, find the appropriate Area abbreviation 
(e.g., APME) under the <strong>"GGF9_DRAFT"</strong> category. Please make sure 
the Area selected is <strong>NOT</strong> under &quot;GGF8_DRAFTS&quot;. For example, 
if you are submitting a draft for the OGSI working group, you would select the 
&quot;ARCH&quot; category under GGF9_DRAFTS.<br>
9. Make sure that both the &quot;Lock this Document&quot; and &quot;This document 
needs to be reviewed&quot; check boxes are <strong>not</strong> checked.<br>
10. Make sure you have read and agree to the &quot;Acceptable Document Usage&quot; 
guidelines and <strong>have selected</strong> the check box.<br>
  11. After pressing &quot;Add File&quot;, you should get a document URL toward 
  the top of your form. If you do not get this URL, the document submission failed 
  and you must retry.<br>
