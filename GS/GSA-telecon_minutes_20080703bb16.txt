TOPICS DISCUSSED:
- Activity delegation as basis for simplest use case. Described by Alexander (see slides at http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.gsa-rg/docman.root.documents.scheduler_interoperability_requi/doc15290)

- Simplest scheduler interop.:
 + Basis as discussed during OGF 23
  * No co-allocation
  * delegation  * (no SLAs, wait for GRAAP negotiation to come to extend the use case) --> SLAs, but no negotiation [decision changed]  * End up with a big profile done by some WG; from GSA comes an informational document  * without reservation  * without SDL  * no security  * no accounting
 + Scope  * See slides from Alexander (see above)  * Specify and realise the "minimal protocol"; could be a reduced form of WS-Agreement; check this + Envisaged outcome  * Two schedulers can bi-directionally delegate activities  * Implementation
 + Alexander will describe the minimal use case by July 18, 2008
 + After the use case description is there, requirements need to be gathered. Obvious already:
  * JSDL HPC Profile is a good one for job requriments description (well-defined, implemented, pc); includes cut-down version of Posix
  * WS-Agreement: creation constraints matching HPC Profile should ensure matching of requirements and offer
 + Implementations by:
  * teikoku (TU Dortmund)
  * GRMS (Poznan, to be checked by Ariel)
  * MetaScheduling Service (FhG SCAI)
  
- Schedule GSA session for Singapore since number of group memembers will be there.
 + Deadline is July 25, 2008! (http://ogf.org/OGF24/chairinfo.php). Yes, this is for the chairs to remember.
