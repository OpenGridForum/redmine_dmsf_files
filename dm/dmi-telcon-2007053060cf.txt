+--

Previous minutes approved without any changes.

Agreed that actions in future would be migrated to be grid forge
artifacts. Michel will migrate any previous actions on to grid forge.

Michel had a phone call with Steve Newhouse. Steve confirmed that the
undo strategy is a child of the supported protocols.  In the data
transfer factory the undo strategy/strategies is/are child elements of a
supported protocol.

Discussion as to whether [supported protocol] should be protocols (as
opposed to protocol) or whether this is purely an XML rendering
issue. Agreed to leave it as is for now.

There was a brief discussion as to whether there should be a default
protocol - as a shorthand (if the user does not specify the protocol
it uses this) - but it was thought it would be simpler to keep the
system as is (no default).

There is no default undo strategy property as a top element of the
factory as there was before. The document has to be changed to reflect
this.

The undo strategy, in the factory, is something that the user can
specify which, if not available, will produce a fault. If the user
does not specify an undo strategy the factory will negotiate an
appropriate one.

The Data Transfer Instance, however, should have an undo strategy
property which describes what is actually being used. This will be
added to the spec.  Possibility not have a single undo strategy - it
could be a list of strategies that the data service instance will do
in a specified order on behalf of the client before it fails. No extra
implementation burden as having more than one is optional.

Identity may have to be revised (including whether we should keep the
concept in the spec). This information is required in addition to the
passing of source/sink credentials in the
requestDataTransferInstance. Question as to whether [Identity] is a
concept that is already out there or whether it's something that we
are trying to create. Also issue as to how this information is passed
to the participants.

Discussion about the Data Transfer Instance - static properties should
be top level property elements while dynamic ones could be sub elements
of something like status (though there was a misunderstanding of what
status is by Mario and Allen - it specifies state machine state and
not actually bytes transferred or that kind of information).

It would be edifying to try to walk through a simple use case of a
Data Transfer Instance and Data Transfer Factory for DMI that does this
for the transfer of a file from point A to point B using, say,
GridFTP.

This led to a discussion of what properties were optional and which
were mandatory. Led to a discussion of the state machine - which also
needs to be re-examined.

Will discuss the state machine at the next DMI call.

Allen will not be available on the 13 or the 20th of June for a call.
