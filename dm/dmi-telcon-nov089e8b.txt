OGSA-DMI Telcon - 11 November 2008
==================================

Attendees:
	Mario Antonioletti [MAA], EPCC
	Steve Newhouse [SN], CERN
	Michel Drescher [MD], Fujitsu
	Shahbaz Memon [SM], FZJ

Agenda:

 - Recap of current status
   - Implementations
   - Renderings
   - Experiences
 - What needs to be done next

+----

Actions:

[SN]  To comment on the plain WS rendering document.
[SM]  To comment on the plain WS rendering document.
[MAA] To have a look at starting off the experiences document for the
      plain WS rendering.
[MD] To try to determine whether the plain WS and WSRF DMI Fujitsu
     implementations can be made available.

MD will be leaving Fujitsu in mid-December and will not be able to
continue working on DMI. MAA thanked MD for having led the group and
for continued to work hard on DMI after he left the chair position. SN
seconded this. Without MD this group would not have progressed as quickly
and as far as it has done.

 - In terms of implementations we have:

   WS-I: Fujitsu, Steven's implementation, FZJ
   WSRF: Fujitsu, FZJ, Globus (stalled).

 - For the rendering documents we have

   A plain WS rendering specification document which is almost
   complete. MAA has commented. SN and SM will try to comment.
   Aim is to try and submit this document to public comment/review
   before the end of the year.

   WSRF rendering specification has not been started as yet. 
   SM will take the lead for producing this document 
   though he cannot start work on this until January.
   MD commented on the difference with the plain WS rendering 
   document - there are six to seven things that overlap that 
   need to be supported by WSRF.

 - Experiences document

   - Plain WS experiences document, there is sufficient stuff on the
     Grid Forge wiki page to probably complete this.  Could try to use
     the ByteIO experiences document as a starting point. MAA will try
     to have a look at this.

   - WSRF implementation experiences document.  Not clear what will
     happen to the Fujitsu WSRF DMI implementation after December.
     Shall wait to see what happens. May be able to try to talk to
     Ravi to resurrect the Globus implementation or possibly try to
     engage with the NorduGrid folks to see if they can help out.

Aim for now is to try and complete the plain WS rendering document
before the end of the year.
