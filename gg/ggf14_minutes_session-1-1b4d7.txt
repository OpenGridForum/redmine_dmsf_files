GGF14 ACS Session #1 (CDDLM and ACS joint session)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date and Time: June 28 14:30-16:00 CDT 2005
Lead:  Keisuke Fukui (Fujitsu)
Notes: Sachiko Wada (Ascade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 14:30 Agenda bashing

* 14:40 Short Overview of ACS
  Material:"Overview of ACS" from GGF13 Meeting Materials
  Keisuke explained briefly about the ACS concepts and service behavior.
  There are some questions from CDDLM team.
  Q. What is the Application Archive(AA)?
  A. AA contains an Archive Descriptor and Application Contents such as 
     application binary and configuration data. AA also contains a 
     Deployment Descriptor.
  Q. Why is the repository required.
  A. Storing the application contents in the repository (ACS) inside 
     the Grid System prior to deployment phase is useful to ensure
     secure and efficient data transport avoiding firewall problems.
     Standardization for the repository interface can enable
     interoperability between heterogeneous Grid Systems.
  Q. Who will develop the reference implementations.
  A. Business Grid and NAREGI have the plan.

* 15:00 CDDLM and ACS sequence
  Material:"Sequence for the possible ACS-CDDLM-interaction" 
  Sequence 1: CDDLM standalone case.
  We answered to the questions from the audience. As a result, it is confirmed
  that there is no problem in our understanding of the CDDLM service behavior.
   - AddFile operation returns url which is used to retrieve uploaded files
     by Component Endpoints.
   - Purpose of the Deployment API is to create Components that are the 
     actual deployment engines.
   - How to clean up the System is an issue. 
   - Client must implement the Component Endpoint which has service 
     specific deployment logic.
  Sequence 2, 3: CDDLM and ACS Collaboration
  We went through a brainstorming about data transportation and security. 
  There is no objection on the sequence at end.
   - GetContetns should support multiple contents retrieval.
   - Steve recommended HTTP to retrieve data.
   - EPR can utilize WS-Naming capabilities.
   - Server authentication may sufficient within the Grid System.

* 15:50 wrap up
