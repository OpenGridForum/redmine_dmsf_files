GGF13 OGSA-WG session #5 - OGSA version 1.0 comments review from EGA
====================================================================

On the bridge:
   Paul Strong  - Chair of EGA Reference Model WG (SUN)
   Debu Chaterjee (Oracle)
   Raj Kumar (HP Labs)

* Background

  - The review document is intended as a starting point for a
    discussion between EGA and OGSA-WG

  - A brief background was given on the EGA work and the reference
    model. Documents are not public yet so they cannot be
    distributed. There is a perceived overlap and possibilities for
    collaboration.
  - The EGA documents will be made public after they are approved. It
    is expected that this may be within 2 weeks or so, but there is no
    fixed deadline.
  - The documents consist of a glossary, the reference model, and use
    cases.
    - The use cases mainly deal with provisioning of components
      (compute, data, applications, etc) in a data center. There is
      similarity with the OGSA CDC use case but the EGA use cases go
      in more detail.

* Procedural issues

  - There was a long debate on whether to respond to the EGA review at
    this time or not. It is difficult to evaluate comparative
    statements without having access to the other side's documents.

  - Consensus reached that OGSA-WG should take the review as feedback
    to OGSA version 1.0 and respond as such. And skip EGA comparison
    for later after EGA documents are made public.
  
* Discussion

  - How close is terminology (glossary)?
    - EGA defined terms are fewer than the ones OGSA defines. Many
      definitions are similar but not identical.

  - Use cases correspondence
    - Some of them may be common, e.g., CDC. EGA has a more detailed
      breakdown of this use case.
    - A good start might be to categorize the use cases and make more
      consistent the description of the ones that are more relevant or
      common to both sides.

  - Would EGA be open to adopting OGSA?
    - This is one of the things being evaluated.
    - One of the EGA outputs is recommendations to users on what
      technologies to use and how those technologies should be used to
      solve problems.
    - And OGSA might be one of the technologies that is proposed.

  - EGA does not want to define standards. It explores what standards
    are there, identifies the gaps and then works with the
    specification owners to fill in those gaps.
    - If there is a needed standard and there is noone to take on that
      job then maybe EGA would try to fill that gap. But so far this
      has not been necessary.

  - EGA and GGF have different processes. EGA is working on allowing
    more access to EGA documents by GGF to ease collaboration.
    - Any company can join EGA and a lot of information is public even
      without joining.
    - In contrast all GGF material are openly available without
      registration.

  - OGSA-WG also has more detailed, technical documents on OGSA and
    will provide these to EGA.

* Comments review

  [The session was consumed mostly on procedural and related
  discussions so there was very little time for this.]

  - Providing context of requirements. This is an issue that will be
    addressed in the next version of the OGSA specification.
  - Suggestion: Provide linkage back to the use cases. That is, show
    how OGSA can be used to satisfy the use cases.

* Next steps

  - Enumerate areas (possibilities) of collaboration
    - Shared set of use cases as one possible topic (Problem is that
      the EGA documents are not public yet).
    - No immediate action
  
  - There is an EGA F2F beginning of April, which Andrew is scheduled
    to attend. By that time OGSA (Hiro, Andrew, Jay) will finish a
    review of the EGA OGSA version 1.0 review.

  - OGSA-WG will comment on the EGA document after it comes out. 
    - No specific date for releasing the document. It is expected
      in early April.
  
  - Arrange for a common session (or two) at the next GGF (Chicago).
  - Arrange for common calls if there is time.
