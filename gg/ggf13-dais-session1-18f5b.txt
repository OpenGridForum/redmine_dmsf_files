GGF13 - DAIS Session 1 - 15/03/05
=================================

Notes: Allen Luniewski

Session meant to be a community update.

Dave Pearson - Community Update
-------------------------------

Foils at: 
http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/dais-wg/document/ggf13-session1-intro/en/1

Malcolm Atkinson: timetable?  
Dave: Ready for submission at GGF-14

Mario Antonioletti - WS-DAI
---------------------------

Speaks about the core specification of DAIS.
        
Malcolm Atkinson: do not consider data management interfaces out 
                  of scope.  These are important. Consider deferring
                  these to a later version of the specification so as
                  to get current work out.

Susan Malaika - WS-DAIR
-----------------------

Speaks about the relational realization of WS-DAI
        
Malcolm Atkinson: WS-DAI does not provide uniform access to data 
                  (e.g., SQL dialects).  This should be called out
                  more explicitly in the specifications.

The CIM work being moved into DAIS will come out as a GGF document.

Amy Krause - WS-DAIX
--------------------

Foils at:

Speaks about the XML realization of WS-DAI
       
Malcolm Atkinson: need to clarify the ability to move the result 
                  cursor forward (skip) and backward

Malcolm Atkinson: what are the issues to be resolved to get the 
                  specifications out by GGF-14?
        
Dave Pearson: minor issues in each of the realizations.  Biggest 
              issue is what mappings to settle on.

Malcolm is clearly urging DAIS to get a first version of the 
specifications out for GGF-14
