(2) Jim Myers described the DFDL prototype PNL are building. He said the code could be made available. There was also discussion of use the WS-DAIX specification (from the DAIS working group)  as in an interface to DFDL described files.      

GGF14 DFDL Session 2
Actions:
Mike Beckerle to write a proposal to describe the mixins proposal and to present to the community
The community to respond to the mixins proposal

Mike Beckerle presented the mixins proposal for DFDL annotations. (See newModel.ppt posted to the mailing list). Mike also referred to the OMG CAM model in his presentation. The mixins proposal shows how to use annotations without introducing many new concepts. The CAM Model constructs can be created from this model.The proposal was well received.
