Question from audience:
*** Question: Tony Hey (UK eScience)

Could you leverage (mimic) any of Internet2 experiences?
They need (use?) trust relationship among multiple organizations
and each organization owns different authentication.

*** Answer:

There is very good example (name?) for attribute service.
It takes care attributes remotely to the other organization.
Attributes are expressed as assertions and it conceptually
works well.

*** Question:
Is authentication outside of your security model?

*** Answer:
Let's take the position of authorization focuse.
For authentication, we need different view and 
it includes issue of shared key and private key.

WS-security interaction between two VO's uses
these keys. How do you manage these keys.
