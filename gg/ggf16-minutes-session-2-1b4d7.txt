* Detailed Discussion for Next Step
 Material: R2AD Vision
 Starting with Mike's presentation of his idea about ACS future use case,
 ACS next step was discussed in detail.

 Keisuke: Regarding to the slide 4, what is the typical use case for the 
       "large complex multi-node system"?
 Mike: Executing parallel tasks across multiple grid systems. For example, 
       video streaming service which processes the images on the fly.

 Keisuke: As for "Distribution Challenges" on slide 9, these challenges may be
       addressed by the other WG/RGs in GGF or existing technologies. 
       For example, OGSA data team addresses data distribution and replication.

 NAREGI: We have a requirement to maintain relationship between single source 
       code and multiple libraries, and we decided to keep the relationship 
       information outside of the AA.
 Keisuke: Since the specification is expected to be composable with other 
       standards/technologies and applicable to various systems, it is 
       preferable to manage the relationship between AAs in domain specific way.
 Mike: My suggestion is adding meta data to AA, such as linkage and type of AA.
       In some case, conditional linkage will be useful.
 Keisuke: To specify meta data, we need to model the relationship based on 
       use case analysis. When we find a appropriate representation for 
       models or relationship, which covers diversity of the ACS enabled 
       systems, it is the time the specification address to this.
 Mike: How about having placeholders in AA for the meantime?

 NAREGI: We are interested in which direction ACS 2.0 will go.
       Currently NAREGI PSE has the following plans:
       - Full Support of ACS V1.0
       - AA management based on policy and role.
 Keisuke: The ACS-WG welcomes the feedback from NAREGI team or any other 
       projects about what is the requirements and how they implement them 
       on top of ACS Spec. 1.0.
