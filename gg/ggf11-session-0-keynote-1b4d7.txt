  Minutes: Andreas Savva

  - Keynote presentation by Ian and Hiro.
  - Dave Snelling announced that the OGSA Use Cases document is
    entering public review

  Q: OGSA has identified an initial factoring but has not gone down to
     the 'operation' level. Going down to that level will give a
     better understanding of the service/capability factoring. Will
     there be time to revisit this later?
  A: For example, EMS did a lot of work on factoring. The work is based on the
     actual experience of people involved---not just trying to imagine
     things. So there is confidence in the factoring.
  A: Focusing on vertical areas so far. It will also be necessary to
     look across these vertical areas and draw out similarities
  A: Revisiting might be necessary. 

  Q: The space is quite large, how to bound it?
  A: A Roadmap document is important to prioritize the work. People
     need to build real systems and start from where they have
     immediate concerns.
