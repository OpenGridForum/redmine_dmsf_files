Outline
	Utility Computing (Presentation by Roger Wright, DMTF Co-Chair)
	EMS
	Resource Modeling (Fred Maciel presenting)

Utility Computing
-------------------------
* Want to sure that varoius management models that get developed in Grid computing should have a home, somewhere to be taken care of
* Desire to be expressed in CIM
* First responsibility is to make sure that there is interoperability
* One particular part of interest is "Server Provisioning and Allocation".
* First place to focus was in fact on construction of common interface, and related CIM based models, 
  for the act of server provisioning and allocation across an enterprise.
* Effort to mature server stack (already have mature storage stack)
* In terms of DMTF model, is this a single entity I interact with to get resources, or do I still interact with the individual resources themselves.
	- Envision a small set of methods, create pool, modify properties on a pool, associate pool with OS and apps, etc.
	- So, pool is analagous to what BES/EMS calls a service container
* Group came up with White Paper, "An Interoperable Server Mgmt Software Stack".
* A profile is a subset of the CIM model that is used to denote an interoperable interface between a client and a server
* SMIS assumes XML CIM on HTTP

EMS
-------
	* Background
		- Where can a service execute?
		- Where should a service execute?
		- Get it ready to execute
		- Start it up
		- Manage it
	* On-going work
	* Other use-cases
	* Other issues punted before
	* What to tackle next.
	
* Since first EMS came out, NAREGI has actually sort of implemented this using UNICORE
* BES has gotten going
	- Resource Model is one of the more interesting things to discuss as we move forward
	- Will there be an event model supported, etc.
	- What management interfaces will be on this
* OGSA RSS BoF being held this GGF
* Time for EMS to look beyond the initial "legacy job" use cases.  What other use cases are relevant now?
* Extend use cases
	- eg. "cache service" example
	- what we can mine from EGA
* Other issues that were punted
	- Accounting/auditing, logging
	- "Provisioning" -- getting ready to run
	- High availability/fault-tolerance hooks/services
	- Disk/storage/caches, etc.
	- Reservations
* What to tackle next?
	- Provisioning?
		-- licenses
		-- binaries
		-- libraries
* OGSA and CDDLM need to sit together and talk about the next steps
	- Schedule on one of the OGSA calls, a discussion with CDDLM
