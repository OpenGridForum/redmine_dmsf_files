<p><strong>Note Well:</strong></p>
<p>All documents or other artifacts submitted to the GridForge repository are 
  subject to the Intellectual Property policy of the GGF. Submitting a document 
  constitutes your agreement with the policy below. If you do not agree with this 
  policy, please do not submit your document.</p>
<p><strong>GGF Intellectual Property Guidelines </strong><br>
  GGF intellectual property right management process is intended to mirror the 
  intellectual property rights and procedures associated with the Internet Standards 
  Process, as outlined in RFC2026, Section 10. The section below is a modified 
  excerpt from RFC2026. </p>
<p>In all matters of intellectual property rights and procedures, the intention 
  is to benefit the Grid community and the public at large, while respecting the 
  legitimate rights of others. </p>
<p>A Contributions </p>
<p>Contributions include verbal statements in GGF meetings, as well as written 
  and electronic communications made at any time or place, which are addressed 
  to: &quot; the GGF plenary session, &quot; any GGF working group or portion 
  thereof, &quot; the GFSG, or any member thereof on behalf of the GFSG, &quot; 
  the GFAC, or any member thereof on behalf of the GFAC, &quot; any GGF mailing 
  list, including any working group or research group list, or any other list 
  functioning under GGF auspices, &quot; the GFD Editor or the GWD process </p>
<p>Statements made outside of a GGF meeting, mailing list or other function, that 
  are clearly not intended to be input to an GGF activity, group or function, 
  are not subject to these provisions. </p>
<p>By submission of a contribution, each person actually submitting the contribution 
  is deemed to agree to the following terms and conditions on his or her own behalf, 
  on behalf of the organization (if any) he or she represents and on behalf of 
  the owners of any propriety rights in the contribution. Where a submission identifies 
  contributors in addition to the contributor(s) who provide the actual submission, 
  the actual submitter(s) represent that each other named contributor was made 
  aware of and agreed to accept the same terms and conditions on his or her own 
  behalf, on behalf of any organization he or she may represent and any known 
  owner of any proprietary rights in the contribution. </p>
<p>B Confidentiality Obligations </p>
<p>No contribution that is subject to any requirement of confidentiality or any 
  restriction on its dissemination may be considered in any part of the GGF document 
  process, and there must be no assumption of any confidentiality obligation with 
  respect to any such contribution. </p>
<p>C Rights and Permissions </p>
<p>In the course of its work developing recommendations, GGF receives contributions 
  in various forms and from many persons. To best facilitate the dissemination 
  of these contributions, it is necessary to understand any intellectual property 
  rights (IPR) relating to the contributions. </p>
<p>1. Some works (e.g. works of the U.S. Government) are not subject to copyright. 
  However, to the extent that the submission is or may be subject to copyright, 
  the contributor, the organization he or she represents (if any) and the owners 
  of any proprietary rights in the contribution, grant an unlimited perpetual, 
  non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license to the GGF under any 
  copyrights in the contribution. This license includes the right to copy, publish 
  and distribute the contribution in any way, and to prepare derivative works 
  that are based on or incorporate all or part of the contribution, the license 
  to such derivative works to be of the same scope as the license of the original 
  contribution. </p>
<p>2. The contributor acknowledges that the GGF has no duty to publish or otherwise 
  use or disseminate any contribution. </p>
<p>3. The contributor grants permission to reference the name(s) and address(es) 
  of the contributor(s) and of the organization(s) he or she represents (if any). 
</p>
<p>4. The contributor represents that contribution properly acknowledges major 
  contributors. </p>
<p>5. The contributor, the organization (if any) he or she represents and the 
  owners of any proprietary rights in the contribution, agree that no information 
  in the contribution is confidential and that the GGF and its affiliated organizations 
  may freely disclose any information in the contribution. </p>
<p>6. The contributor represents that he or she has disclosed the existence of 
  any proprietary or intellectual property rights in the contribution that are 
  reasonably and personally known to the contributor. The contributor does not 
  represent that he or she personally knows of all potentially pertinent proprietary 
  and intellectual property rights owned or claimed by the organization he or 
  she represents (if any) or third parties. </p>
<p>7. The contributor represents that there are no limits to the contributor's 
  ability to make the grants acknowledgments and agreements above that are reasonably 
  and personally known to the contributor. </p>
<p>By ratifying this description of the GGF process the GGF warrants that it will 
  not inhibit the traditional open and free access to GGF documents for which 
  license and right have been assigned according to the procedures set forth in 
  this section, including GWD's and GFD's. This warrant is perpetual and will 
  not be revoked by the GGF or its successors or assigns. </p>
<p>Where any patents, patent applications, or other proprietary rights are known, 
  or claimed, with respect to any GGF document, and brought to the attention of 
  the GFSG, the GFSG shall not advance the document without including in the document 
  a note indicating the existence of such rights, or claimed rights. Where implementations 
  are required before advancement of a specification, only implementations that 
  have, by statement of the implementers, taken adequate steps to comply with 
  any such rights, or claimed rights, shall be considered for the purpose of showing 
  the adequacy of the specification. </p>
<p>The GFSG disclaims any responsibility for identifying the existence of or for 
  evaluating the applicability of any claimed copyrights, patents, patent applications, 
  or other rights in the fulfilling of the its obligations as outlined in the 
  previous paragraph, and will take no position on the validity or scope of any 
  such rights. </p>
<p>Where the GFSG knows of rights, or claimed rights, the GGF secretariat shall 
  attempt to obtain from the claimant of such rights, a written assurance that 
  upon approval by the GFSG of the relevant GGF document(s), any party will be 
  able to obtain the right to implement, use and distribute the technology or 
  works when implementing, using or distributing technology based upon the specific 
  specification(s) under openly specified, reasonable, non-discriminatory terms. 
  The working group or research group proposing the use of the technology with 
  respect to which the proprietary rights are claimed may assist the GGF secretariat 
  in this effort. The results of this procedure shall not affect advancement of 
  document, except that the GFSG may defer approval where a delay may facilitate 
  the obtaining of such assurances. The results will, however, be recorded by 
  the GGF Secretariat, and made available. The GFSG may also direct that a summary 
  of the results be included in any GFD published containing the specification. 
</p>
<p>C.1 Determination of Reasonable and Non-discriminatory Terms </p>
<p>The GFSG will not make any explicit determination that the assurance of reasonable 
  and non-discriminatory terms for the use of a technology has been fulfilled 
  in practice. It will instead use the normal requirements for the advancement 
  of GGF recommendations track documents to verify that the terms for use are 
  reasonable. If the two unrelated implementations of the specification that are 
  required to advance from Proposed Recommendation to Draft Recommendation have 
  been produced by different organizations or individuals or if the &quot;significant 
  implementation and successful operational experience&quot; required to advance 
  from Draft Recommendation to Recommendation has been achieved the assumption 
  is that the terms must be reasonable and to some degree, non-discriminatory. 
  This assumption may be challenged during the open comment period. </p>
<p>C.2 Notices </p>
<p>The following IPR notice shall be included in all GGF documents: </p>
<p>The GGF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual 
  property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation 
  or use of the technology described in this document or the extent to which any 
  license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent 
  that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Copies of claims of 
  rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made 
  available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission 
  for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this specification 
  can be obtained from the GGF Secretariat. </p>
<p>The GGF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any copyrights, 
  patents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights which may cover 
  technology that may be required to practice this recommendation. Please address 
  the information to the GGF Executive Director. </p>
<p>Explicit statements about IPR should not be included in the document, because 
  including a specific claim implies that the claim is valid and that the listed 
  claims are exhaustive. Once a document has been published as a final GFD there 
  is no mechanism to effectively update the IPR information. Authors should instead 
  provide the GGF secretariat with any explicit statements or potentially relevant 
  claims. <br>
