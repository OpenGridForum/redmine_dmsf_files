- Model use case from RINGrid
The use case template that we have worked on during the session in Boston has been presented.
We have discussed about some extension of that use case

During the discussion about model use case coming from RINGrid project we agreed that
it will be the good starting point, and base for extension and comparison with next coming use cases
