Agenda
======

1) Early discussion
- Minutes approval
  -- 16 May 07 minutes approved without changes
- Action item review
  -- location of [supported protocols] in the DEPR
	  -- The information about protocols an endpoint supports 
	     [supported protocols] should be plaed in the Metadata section 
		 of the EPR.
		 Reasoning: Metadata is seen as information *about* an Endpoint
					and not information that is required to *identify* 
					an endpoint, which would be true for reference parameters.

2) Functional Specification
- On the DTF and its global properties
The group recognised a mismatch between association of the [undo strategy]
with the DTF and its prose description. While the prose description suggests
the DTF supports one and only one [undo strategy] the following sections 
suggest a different model. We need to reconcile on this issue and clean up 
the spec accordingly.
The group agrees that the [undo strategy] should not be a global property on 
the DTF. Instead, the [undo strategy]  should be part of the 
[supported protocol] global property, and it should remain as an optional 
argument in the "requestDataTransferInstance" operation.

- On the undo attribute:
There is concern whether the specification is implementable using existing 
data transfer protocols. We need illustrative examples that ensure diligence 
in the specification design.
