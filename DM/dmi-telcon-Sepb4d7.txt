- Summary of OGF24

  OGF24 turned out to be a very small event - low registration. Had a
  45 minute session. About 10 people turned up. Did a live demo
  between the Microsoft and Fujitsu's implementations. Had a quick run
  through as to how the interop was done. 

  Try to do the final set of documents now to take the spec to its
  recommendation status. No new members were picked up.

  Michel attended the data area meeting - talked about DMI, importance
  to grid implementors to implement this. Also for the need to have
  services that can create DataEPRs. Tried to outline how DMI fits in
  the standards and implementations space.

  Low attendance probably to do with the distance to travel to
  Singapore.

  Agree at the meeting that Steve will start writing the experiences
  document while Michel does the plain web services rendering
  document.

- Implementations

  Currently looking for a partner WSRF implementation - Fujitsu has
  one. Michel keen to start testing but we need another
  implementation.

  Hope to get Unicore involvement as well activity from Globus.

- Nordugrid conference invite

  Looks like no one will be able to make this meeting so may have to
  politely decline.

- DMI WSI Rendering

  Michel posted a version of the document to the mailing list.  

  http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/ogsa-dmi-wg/2008-September/000453.html

  Wants to use section 3 as a template for the rest of the document.
  Intro needs to be fleshed out. Currently explains that we have some
  duplicated entries. Microsoft toolkit required the double elements
  but living in different namespaces.

  Mario commented on the document distributed:

  http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/ogsa-dmi-wg/2008-September/000454.html

  Discussed the appropriate of the use of MUST in some of the
  examples in section 3. Michel will have a look.

  Mario also had some issues about some of the security requirements
  but this was just a cut and paste from the functional spec and will
  be revised.

  Mario made some other minor changes but the document seemed ok.

  Michel asked for feedback as to how the faults section should be
  rendered. Michel is going to try to produce examples of possible
  ways. Possibly detail how the first fault should be rendered in
  a SOAP message and use this a pattern for the other fault messages
  so they do not have to be shown in detail. 
  then

  Allen is going to try to have a look at the document.
  Need to get feedback from Ravi and Shahbaz.

- Planning

   Michel is completing the WSI rendering document.
   Steve is writing the experiences document.
   Waiting for another WSRF-based implementation to do interop with.

   Michel asked whether there are going to be any implementations that
   could be demonstrated at SC08 - can we have a complete
   implementation to demo there? Need to ask Ravi and Shahbaz.

   Next call will take place when there more progress has been made-
   Steve or Michel will flag.

   Allen busy for the next 2 weeks.
