[MAA] Look at Shahbaz's WSRF DMI rendering.

[MAA] Ask Allen to comment on the proposal on the wiki.

[DM] Enumerate the extensibility points required in the DMI spec.

[DM] Add suggested changes to the text in the functional spec.

Completed Actions:
------------------

[MAA] Point folks to the Plain WS Rendering of the DMI spec.

Mario apologised for not having been able to find the time to do the
draft a straw man document for the multiple transfer DTI. 

In the meantime (or because of this) Dave posted out a proposal:

http://code.google.com/p/dtsproject/wiki/DMI_JSDL_Issues

It would be good if interested parties could comment on this (though
wait until after September the 11th as Dave would like to add more
content).

In effect a number of changes are requested by the DataMinx folks:

1. Addition of a number of extensibility points to some of the existing
   elements in the functional spec. David Meredith will enumerate these
   on the wiki.
2. Changes to some of the text in the functional spec to make it a little
   less web service specific. The DataMinx folks would like to come up
   with a RESTful rendering specification and this would help them do
   this.
3. Be able to encapsulate multiple transfers within a single DTI.
   This needs to be scoped out and a straw man proposed. It is not
   clear as yet how this would be taken forward - suggested change
   to the existing spec, a new version of the spec or an addendum 
   to the spec. This possibly the most contentious of all the suggested
   changes but it is hoped that once it is detailed and scoped it
   may be palatable to the working group as a whole.
4. Come up with a RESTful rendering for the DMI spec.

Points 1 and 2 could be made to the existing specification, not clear
how 3 is taken forward and once 1-3 are done then that allows 4 to
take place.

Mario is keen for this to take place if the specification is going to
be adopted and used. He is going to try to come up with at least a
template document that can then be iterated amongst the participants.

It was suggested that it would be good if Steve Crouch could be
involved. Mario is going to get in touch with him.

Another telcon will take place in two weeks time to see what
progress has been made.

DONM: 8am UK time (GMT+1) on September 24th.
