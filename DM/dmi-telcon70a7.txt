- OGF23 Review

  Notes were sent out.

- Rendering documents

  Getting quick convergence on the WSDL.
  Some interactions have been taking place between Steven and
  Michel.

  The important thing is to have normative XML going across the wire -
  tweak the XML Schema to do this.

  Some small changes have been made to the functional spec to 
  keep things in line - mainly in the schema, WS-DL, etc.
  Typos fixes too.
  
  Michel will start to write the normative WSDL/Schema rendering
  document - with some help from his friends.

- Implementations

  Michel has a DTF up and running that is halfway implemented.  Have
  not done the other operations yet - can use this as the basis for
  testing.

  Steve making progress too.

- Interop

  Don't need to worry about this now. 

- Timetable

  Things will be clearer once implementations are done.

- AOB

  Calls will be moving to Fridays at 5pm (UK time). Starting from 20th
