Reviewed changes done to the document:

Steven did made changes to the faults, security section and the get
attributes operations for the factory and the data transfer instance.

Added getFactoryAttributesDocument() operation in section 4.1.

Michel thought that an xs:any should be added in case there are
additional attributes that could be returned to the client [for the
XML representation in section 4.2.1.1].

Lowered the case of the first letter of the start, activate, stop,
restart and suspend operations for consistency. Also added a
getInstanceAttributesDocument operation.

Added failed-{clean,unclean, unknown} failed faults (same as the
states.

getStatus operation defined in section 5.2.6.

The xs:any should be at the top of the complex type, before the
defined elements else there are parsing problems.

In section 5.3 have two new faults: IncorrectStateFault and
FailedStateTransitionFault. Semantics are as in the document.

States can change without user intervention - the text in the document
currently seems to suggest that all state changes are user
driven. Text to be changed to indicate this should be changed.

Sections 5.4.1.6-8 has new text on the failed states.

Section 6 contains information about the security.

Section 12 (Renderings) will have a section for the XML relating to
the spec, common XML Schema and WSDL for the DTF and DTI. Additional
renderings may be placed in other documents.

SN will make some more changes and accept changes. 
MD then to create the XML Schema and WSDL to be done for next week.
Group will then work on a slide set for OGF.

Michel and Steven will be at OGF - Mario will try to call in, Allen
is not sure yet if he can make it to OGF.

Start socialising the spec and trying to get key people and groups to
look over it.
