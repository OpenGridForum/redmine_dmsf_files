- Implementations and Interop progress

 Michel and Steven have been working on interop. 

 Currently can both get factory attributes from each other's
 implementations, can also create DTIs from each other's
 implementations. Michel can create a DTI on Steven's implementation
 and it works. Steven has not yet tried it out on Michel's implementation.

 Time zone difference has been a bit of a burden.

 Have had some SOAP 1.1 issues - .Net has two sets of settings.
 Steven's clients were originally speaking SOAP 1.2 while Michel's
 server understood  SOAP 1.1. Steven can now use 1.1 on his client. 

 Main obstacles overcome: security infrastructure sorted, protocols
 are communicating with each other - now massaging the XML messages is
 being done which is a lesser but not trivial problem. Semantics are
 right but the XML processing works slightly differently across the
 implementations - question as to how low we want to drill into this.

 The basic interop is done for the factory and instance services.

 To what level do we want a continue developing test case/scenarios to
 test the specifications? Can do it at the high level and then leave
 the rest to compliance testing?

 Are errors dealt with correctly? 

 Michel set up a wiki page with test cases that we want to try 
 out:

 http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.ogsa-dmi-wg/wiki/HomePage

  Need to cover the Data EPRs, check that we can set up a transfer
  and successfully transfer data. Also, do some faults testing. Set up the
  basic mechanisms to test inter operation but we do not have to do
  this exhaustively.

  Currently doing the plain web services rendering interop. 
  Steven will not go on to do a WSRF rendering. We need to have
  participants from the WSRF camp - possibly Jeulich Unicore or Globus
  but carrying out this exercise has been really useful. Validating
  the core stuff - the WSRF rendering is really a wrapper round that
  core bit.

  Thus far we are on track. Have six months to do all of this.
  Would be nice to have  a third person involved in order to
  validate the spec.
 
  By OGF would expect that we will have Steven and Michel's stuff 
  interop'ing fully and should have the basic stuff that needs to 
  bed tested on the wiki page.

- OGF24 Planning

  A 45 minute DMI session requested. At the moment Steven appears 
  to be the only person that is planning to attend OGF. Michel,
  Allen and Mario are not - Ravi was not sure.

  The standards council is planning to have a plenary event at OGF24
  to talk about the uptake of standards work. Plan to talk about
  standards across various groups - Steven can plug the DMI work
  at this session.
 
- Rendering documents

  Michel has sent out the WSDL to Steve - WSDL did not contain SOAP
  binding information for either SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 - lead to some issues
  but this is sorted out now.
 
  Now have SOAP 1.1 bindings. The WSDL is now fairly mature. Can start
  to feed things back to the rendering documents.

  Things are working well.

  Michel and Steven will continue working on the interop and try to
  find the sensitive parts to work on and use this together with the 
  XML generated to build the rendering documents.
  
  If we can present the results of the interop activities we may get
  further engagement from the broader community.

  Michel and Steven will announce when they are ready to move on to the
  next stage and get more people involved.

  Steven/Michel will flag when they think we should have another call.
