<h3>Goals:</h3>

<p>Provide a forum where parties interested in the secure, robust,
high speed transport of data in the wide area and related technologies
can discuss and coordinate issues. Note that this RG and GGF in
general do not &quot;promote&quot; research, they simply provide a
forum for coordination and standardization. For this reason, we plan
on having the broadest possible interpretation of our
charter. Ultimately, the test is whether or not the subject is
transport related and sufficient people show intest. This RG should be
a WG &quot;factory&quot; spawning off WGs in areas where sufficient
common interest is shown.</p>

<h3>Coordination Required:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Grid High Performance Network Group (GGF)</li>
  <li>Replication Network Group (GGF)</li>
  <li>IETF (possible for some items)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Projected Tasks:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Develop appropriate scenarios to use as guidelines and
test cases (DOC, Possbile WG).</li>
  <li>Agree on operations necessary at remote sites. This
will help us understand interfaces and possible protocol support needed.</li>
  <li>Requirements for a General Transport Protocol (DOC,
possible WG)</li>
  <li>Implementation requirements for a Transport system
(possible DOC, possible WG)</li>
  <li>Performance Issues related to high speed, bulk data
transport (presentations)</li>

  <li>Evaluation of alternative bulk data transport mechanisms.&nbsp;
This could include modified TCP, non-TCP, and non-IP
based&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanism (presentations)</li>

  <li>Requirements for Asynchronous and Heterogeneous Data Transport (DOC,
    Possible WG)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lifetime:</h3>
<p>This RG has an indefinite life time. While it holds value as a forum for
discussions and presentations, it will also strive to produce focused WGs that
have a limited lifetime and produce standards track documents.</p>
