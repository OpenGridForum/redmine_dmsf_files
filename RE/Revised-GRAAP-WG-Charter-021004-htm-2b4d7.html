<h3>GRAAP WG Charter:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The GGF Scheduling and Resource Management Area is concerned with
various issues relating to resource scheduling and resource
management in Grid environments.  To make use of distributed
resources within the Grid at the same time to solve a problem a
Super-Scheduling Service is necessary. Through this service access
to and use of various resources managed by different schedulers in
use within a Grid will be possible.
The Grid Resource Allocation Agreement Protocol Working Group
addresses the protocol between a Super-Scheduler (Grid Level
Scheduler) and local Schedulers necessary to reserve and allocate
resources in the Grid as a building block for this service.

<p>
<h4>Focus/Purpose:</h4>
This working group has the goal to produce a set of documents
describing a common resource allocation agreement protocol for
Grid environments. The protocol supports all negotiations a
Super-Scheduler (Grid Level Scheduler) and local scheduling
systems have to go through making Grid resources available to
accomplish a given task, e.g. (advance) reservation, allocation,
de-allocation.

<h4>Scope:</h4>
Initially, the scope of this activity will comprise CPU and
Networking resources.  Other resources may be added as (public)
scheduling interfaces become available for those types of
distributed resources in the Grid.

<h4>Goals:</h4>
The objective of this Working Group is to support and enhance
concurrent requests of resources from different independent
scheduling systems by providing an inter-scheduler protocol
for communications between higher-level services, such as a
Super-Scheduler or an agent acting on behalf of the user,
and the independent local schedulers. Advance Reservations
will be supported through this protocol. 

<h4>Class of documents:</h4>
The intermediate documents will be of class information or
recommendation, the final one will be a proposed standard.

<h4>Status:</h4>
Our charter, which is available in full as <a href="../projects/graap-wg/document/GRAAP-WG-Charter/en/1/GRAAP-WG-Charter.html">pdf</a>, has been approved by 

GFSG! At GGF6, the group approved a slightly revised charter, with revised milestones, which is available as <a 

href="../projects/graap-wg/document/Revised-GRAAP-WG-Charter-021004-pdf/en/1/Revised-GRAAP-WG-Charter-021004-pdf.html">pdf</a> and <a
