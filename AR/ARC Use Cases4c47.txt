Description:
  In case of user client directly communicating execution service access pattern (client to service) is unpredictable and may contain long inactivity intervals. Hence it is desirable for Execution service not to forget about finished job immediately in order to report result of job execution to client.

Description:
  The job may use relatively big (put into file) set of input parameters generated dynamically by user's software. It is desirable to make it possible to include such input data with job description. This may be implemented by storing such files on some storage service prior to submitting jobs. But that would require user's software to handle their lifetime hence introducing additional complexity. Also users not having control over long-life storage resources would be ruled out.
