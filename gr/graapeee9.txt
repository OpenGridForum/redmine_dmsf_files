+ GRAAP session #2

- IPR
- For main content, please refer to the slides: https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc16286?nav=1

- Discussion on integration of CreationConstraints into NegotiableTemplates
 + Would imply changes to normative part. This would lead to another PC.
 + Decision: Defer to WSAG Negotiation 1.1.

- Wolfgang explains the plans for term langauges based on work done in the OPTIMIS project.
 + These should result in a term language informational document
 + Term language for trust. Discussion re. direction of OPTIMIS work
  * (Ramin) What is the objective here? - A (Wolfgang) Build an end-to-end trust understanding in OPTIMIS.
  * (Ramin) Do we want to have this in WS-Agreement? - A (Wolfgang) Want to have an informational document on how to use term languages in WS-Agreement.
  * (Ramin) Do not see a chance that people take this definition up in the community?
  * {Alan) There is a risk since there is something like WS-Trust. Could cause semantic problems. Maybe re-name.
  * (Alan) An auditing mechanism working with WS-Agreement and WS-Trust would be a handy thing to have. People need that. 
  * (Philipp) Concentrate on the QoS parameters / KPIs within GRAAP instead of term languages.
 + (Ramin) We should understand whether the term language is something with a value for the community.
 + (Yuri) Could provide use cases for WS-Agreement from the GEYSERS project which defines a service delivery framework. Two main aspects of service neg.: security context and trust.
 + (Ramin) Cut out certain parts that are of use for a larger community. Candidates: eco-efficiency.
 + (Ramin) What about negotiating EC2-like instances? Term language exists?
  * Work planned/done in DGSI.
  * (Oliver) A lot is already there. Should be not much more than taking information from three DGSI deliverables and make an OGF document out of it.
  * (Ramin) Be OCCI-compliant.
  * (Alexander) OCCI is not sufficient. Lacks e.g. storage access.
  * ... 
  * (Ramin) We know the use case. (Alexander) Depends on whom we want to target / who are the stakeholders. (Ramin) Let us say OpenNebula / Openstack.
  * Agreement: Start with a use case from GRAAP and distribute it to the community-at-large.

[Action] Alexander will check and provide info. VM described using JSDL.

[Action] Philipp will check SLA@SOI infrastructure template re. this term language.

[Action] Wolfgang will reduce the OPTIMIS document to the core, add a use case, send it to GRAAP for discussion. Then re-iterate the document.

- GEYSERS presentations for next OGF
 
- KPIs
 +  Based on DGSI document D1.6
 + informational document vs. normative spec
 + (Ramin) questionable whether terms/KPIs will be accepted by community
 + (Matthias?) should base on well-accepted non-IT specs or go for standards such as ITIL

[Action] Check content of KPI document versus ITIL/...

[Action] Wolfgang will reduce the DGSI document to the core, add a use case, send it to GRAAP for discussion. Then re-iterate the document.
