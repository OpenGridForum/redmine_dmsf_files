--------------------
- GRAAP session #1 -
--------------------
[NOTE: see presentation '01_graap_sessions.pdf']

Agenda:
+ State of the spec
+ Last changes before submission (Toshi Nakata, 20 min)
+ Implementation
  * VIOLA Implementation (Oliver Wäldrich, 20 min)
  * AssessGrid: SLA structure & GT4 implementation issue (Dominic Battre, 20 min)
+ Discussion of features not considered in WS-Agreement V1.0


Status of the WS-Agreement specification
----------------------------------------
+ IPR presented
+ GFSG discussed the spec yesterday, but since the GFSG was not complete, it was decided to wait anoter week for the final call


Latest changes to the spec (Toshi Nakata)
-----------------------------------------
[Note: see presentation '02_status_ws-agr_spec.pdf']

+ Toshi reported mainly minor bug fixes


"VIOLA WS-Agreement implementation" (Oliver Waeldrich)
----------------------------------------------------
[Note: see presentation '03_viola_wsag_implementation.pdf']

+ Lessons learned from a first version presented
+ Status of current implementation presented: follows the latest draft
+ Implementation available (meta-scheduler and WS-Agreement for Java (WSAG4J))


"AssessGrid: Implementation Experiences with WS-AG" (Dominic Battré)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Note: see presentation '04_assessgrid_implementation.pdf']

+ Based on Globus
+ Details on SLOs and guarantee terms presented on request
+ Implementation tries to be as close to the WS-Agreement spec as possible


Discussion on features not considered in WS-Agreement 1.0
---------------------------------------------------------
[Note: Please also refer to slide 6 of the presentation '01_graap_sessions.pdf'. Wolfgang collected the issues online during the discussion.]

+ Toshi: Common set of service description terms (considered JSDL, but does not fulfil all requirements)
 * Covers things like CPU, memory, etc.
 * Things like "response time" etc. are not covered
 * Question: what kinds of terms do people need? -> Omer: This is very domain-specific and you will always have people who miss stuff.
 * Ariel: GSA-RG work could be used [Note Philipp: i.e. work on JSDL profiling for scheduling and a language to describe scheduling terms for the GSA-RG interop. use case], should be investigated, continue discussion at GSA_RG session (Wed. 9, 6pm, Exchange 2/3)

+ Define application domains for SLAs, use cases
 * Omer: use case from markets
 * Oliver: scheduling & RMS use case
 * To be ready before OGF 21

+ Proposal (Dominic): Share WS-Agreement templates (repository)
+ Paul Strong (co-chair of reference model) defining terms for OGSA
+ Creation constraints, evaluation of XPATH expressions when using SOAP messages
+ Monitoring: how to verify SLAs? Not a topic to be resolved in GRAAP, but could provide hints

-> Wolfgang: First two issues are the most urgent currently


--------------------
- GRAAP session #2 -
--------------------
[NOTE: see presentation '01_graap_sessions.pdf']

Agenda
+ Implementation/Interoperability discussion
  * Hosting environment issues (recommendation?)
  * Interoperability activities started 
+ Scenarios/use cases for dynamic SLAs and negotiation


Hosting environment
-------------------
+ Most crucial: WSRF, WS-Adressing
+ Oliver: Problems: Globus implements draft version of WSRF-RP/BaseFaults, also WS-Adressing
+ Dominic: Namespace problem; structural problem
+ Philipp: Gobus roadmap? -> Dominic: On the roadmap, but no times given. -> Contact Globus Alliance


Interoperability activities
---------------------------
[NOTE: please refer to http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dd2wwjk8_0d7b58b (shared Google document). Edited online during the session.]

+ Question [Wolfgang]: Suggestions by the GFSG wrt to interop? -> [Ramin] No. Up to the group.
+ Contact to ETSI, maybe a possibility to do this interop. test in a more formal way.
+ Document for the GFSG needed describing interop. scenario and what is validate. Ready by OGF 21.
+ Negotiation discussion started [see slide 8 and 9 of '01_graap_sessions.pdf']


Scenarios/use cases for dynamic SLAs and negotiation
----------------------------------------------------
[NOTE: Please refer to slide 10 of '01_graap_sessions.pdf']


--------------------
- GRAAP session #3 -
--------------------
Agenda:
+ Performance comparison between a 3 phases and a 2 phases negotiation protocol (Antoine Pichot, 20 min, see '05_protocol_comparison.pdf')
+ AssessGrid Negotiation Scenarios in AssessGrid and implications for negotiation procedures (Dominic Battre, 20 min, see '06_assessgrid_neg_scenarios.pdf')
+ Implementing negotiation protocols in Ontogrid (Shamima Paurobally, 20 min, see '07_ontogrid_negotiation.pdf') 
 * Switch to WS-Agreement evaluated. Interested only in the vocabulary, not protocol.

[NOTE: Wolfgang took notes during the session, please refer to '01_graap_sessions.pdf', slide 12 and 13. for the presentations and slide 14 and slide 15 for more on implementations and the interop discussion]
