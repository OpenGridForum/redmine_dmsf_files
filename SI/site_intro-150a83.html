    we plan to make GGF GridForge the central workspace for the GGF community.&nbsp; 
    This site is in &quot;friendly user&quot; mode and we invite you as a member of the 
    community to help us evaluate and develop the structure of the site. To 
    participate, please
    <a href="https://forge.gridforum.org/account/register.php" style="text-decoration: none">
    create a user account</a>. We expect to 
    go &quot;production&quot; in July but will continue to refine the tools and 
    capabilities available at the site. Your 
    participation and feedback will be invaluable as we tune it to the needs of GGF 
    participants.</font></p>

    structure of the site provides a &quot;project&quot; for each GGF

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana">Initially we 
    are supporting document management and review within groups as well as 
    &quot;trackers&quot; which allow specific actions (e.g. review this document, or 
    complete a task by a certain date, etc.) to be assigned to members of the 
    project. The project areas are administered by the working group or research 
    group chairs rather than centrally by GGF staff.&nbsp; Without a GGF 
    GridForge login, you will have access to all of the project documents and 
    related information about GGF.&nbsp; By creating a login, however, you are 
    able to participate in ways that anonymous users cannot.&nbsp; For example, 
    if you are participating in a working group or research group as a document 
    author or editor you will want to create a login so that the working group 
    or research group chairs can add you to the project membership list.&nbsp; 
    This allows you to participate in document review and other activities such 
    as document bug trackers.</font></p>

    GGF Editor project</a> is where GGF drafts may be submitted to the editor, 
    and where anyone may track the progress of such submissions. Program 
    committees for GGF meetings, the GFSG, the GFAC, and other groups will also 
    have projects where they can work together. (note the GGF Editor's public 
    comment site will remain at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggf">

    officially launches)</font></p>
