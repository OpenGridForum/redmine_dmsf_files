DRMAA-WG, GGF 9, Chicago, IL		 8-9:30 A.M., Oct, 07, 2003


Hrabri Rajic:  DRMAA introduction, GGF IP
Attendance 10, the lowest ever, no surprise, the spec has been completed.

Andreas Haas: C Bindings presentation
Documents:
	DRMAA language independent spec
	DRMAA C bindings doc
	DRMAA Java bindings doc

C Bidnings doc:
One C function per DRMAA operation
Who benefits?
	End users at run time use appropriate lib
	Developers -- one interface

Grid Engine source available at Grid Engine source


Java Bindings:  Daniel Templeton
Why Java?  Well adopted, Web Services, JAX pack, Apache, OGSI interoperability
Classes
	DRMAASession
	DRMAASessionFactory
	JobTemplate
	JobInfo
Exceptions
	Hierarchical
	Single base class
	Coresponds directly to errors in spec
	Makes for much prettier code
Design Decisions
	naming does not follow spec
	API/SPI ala Jax Pack
	Simplified exception signatures
		Ala JDBC
		Can still catch more specific exceptions

Open issues
C articrafts:  Buffers
Exception mapping
Factory
JobTemplate.delete()
JobTemplate.(s|g)etAttributes(Values?)?

WS bindigs
	JAx-RPC outputs nonsense, need something else
	Statefull WS
	Blocking calls are issues ( not needed )
	Options for WSDL buildings: stubs by hand, stubs from C bindings,
	from flat Java class,
GWSDL
	Beter fit than WSDL
	GS are stateful
	Factory pattern
	GT3 translator of Java flat class
	Brings DRMAA closer to OGSI/OGSA


DRMAA Compliance test:  By Andreas Haas
	DRMAA library dependency ( Pthread, OpenSSL, .. )
	Test plan
	Report
		Environment
		DRM system
