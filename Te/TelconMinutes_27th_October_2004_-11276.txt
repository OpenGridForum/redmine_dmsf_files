Hi,

This is what we talked about in todays telcon:

Present: Tony Fletcher, Dieter Gawlick, Jim Webber, Torsten Steinbach

New TelCon time will be Monday's at 8 pm GMT (which is 9 pm in Germany, 8 pm in UK, 3 pm at east coast, noon at west coast and 7 am the following day in Sydney). This will be efective beginning next week.

Tony will incorporate the auditability requirement into the TWIST use case and then update the master document available on GridForge.

To explore the similarity of TWIST and Trip use cases it would be useful to have similar flow drawings as for TWIST use case in the trip use case document. Torsten & Dieter will try look into this.

Transactional Spec Education Calls:

1. Tony has accepted to present BTP in our regular call on Monday, Nov. 8th.

2. Jim tries to get Malik Saheb presenting in the week after (Nov. 15th).

3. Ian had already offered to present on Wednesday, 24th (old call times). Torsten will try to get him presenting on Tuesday 22nd 8 pm GMT.

It is very important to get good people activated for these presentations. Everyone should announce these presentations in his direct network.

We will also announce these presentation in OGSA mailing list.

Next monday we will discuss the Grid resource management use case in our regular call (8 pm GMT).

Cheers, Torsten.
