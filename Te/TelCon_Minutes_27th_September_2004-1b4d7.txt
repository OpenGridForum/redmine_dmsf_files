TM-RG Tele Conference, September 27th 2004.

Present: Ian Robinson, Dieter Gawlick, Joerg Seitter, Torsten Steinbach, Jim Webber

First we discussed the eDiaMoND use case. It needs to be reworked in a way that the atual use case requirements become clear. We need an use case owner todrive this. Jim volunteered to act as a backup at least. He will approach David Power if he would like to take the lead in this matter.

Jim already is responsible for the Checkpointing Use Case that he proposed. Dieter mentioned he is potentialy also involved for a second use case beside the trip support: credit verification. Torsten suggests that we wait for the new version of the escrow paper before continuing with discussion about credit verification as a use case.

The trip support use case is already worked out to a sufficient extent. Torsten needs to update the use case master document to reflect the latest changes.

It was agreed that we will combine separate transaction specification tele meetings (one for each spec) with discussion about how to implement the use cases using the presented spec. Beside trip support we should have other use cases ready for this excersice. Jim will work on the checkpointing case for this purpose in the next weeks. Torsten will ask Tony if he could do the same for his proposals.

We will have a dedicated use case telcon on Tuesday, 12th at the usual time. We want to discuss checkpointing and one further use case then.

The first transaction spec tele meeting will be held on Wednesday 20th. Ian will present WS-C/BA/AT. Dieter volunteered to organize the necessary tele meeting facility. He will also set up a little test session prior to 20th with Torsten.

Torsten will ask Tony and Mark Little to do the presentations of BTP and WS-CAF in the weeks after.

Next meeting: 12th of Oktober.
