2. Introduction:
----------------
  
  2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.  Background
      to the project is another alternative. (E.g. 100 words).

The goal of the Grid-TLSE project is to design an expert site for sparse 
matrices. This web site provides tools and software for sparse matrices. It also includes a bibliography on sparse matrix software and collections of sparse matrices. 



  2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
----------------------------------------------------------  
  
  Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.  E.g. "move
  a file from A to B," "start a job."
  
  Please include figures if possible.

  If your use case requires multiple components of functionality, please  
  provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet points of 50
  words per functionality are acceptable.
  
 Example of scenario : determination of the best symmetric permutation

	- Identify all the symmetric permutations available
	on the TLSE grid
		for each symmetric permutation
		   do
		      select one serve offering the symmetric permutation
		      send the matrix to the server
		      start calculation
		      recover the results
		   done
 	- Determine the symmetric permutation that provided
	  the minimun fill-in.
	- Send back the answer to the user
  

  
4. Customers:
-------------

  Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In particular,
  where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and for whom it occurs.  
  E.g. max 40 words

 There are two classes of users :
	- expert users that are deploying sparse linear algebra
sofware over our grid and proceed to experiments aiming at comparing,
debugging, ... their sofwares.
	- non-expert users that are mainly interested by uploading
their matrices and determine which solver or which machine is the
most efficient in terms of memory, execution time,... for their problems.

  
5. Involved Resources:
----------------------

  5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
      software might be involved.

. Softwares : large number of sparse softwares
. A large database that hold description of the solvers, the computers
available, informations related to the users, results of experiments
and matrix collections.
. The TLSE gird will involve a wide range of computers from PC
up to large parallel computers so that users may proceed to a 
wide range of experiments.

  
  5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?

At national level and we may anticipate utilization of computers
in foreign countries.

  
  5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
      many remote tasks are executing at the same time?

Typically we anticipate tens up to hundreds.

  
  5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
      available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort 
      of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is 
      their availablility;  do you regularly work from source 
      code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages 
      are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g. 
      Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.

The sparse linear algebra software is either open source or
available in libraries such as Harwell Subroutine Library.
The code we deveoped is open source. DIET is also publically available.

  
  5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
      authorities, or registries.

The expert site only requires a on-line registration to identify users.

  
  5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute 
      or data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical 
      imaging instruments.

NO

  
  5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like 
      systems?

      [x] Exclusively
      [ ] Often (say 50-50)
      [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
      [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.



  
6. Environment:
---------------

  Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
  for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the user
  environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).

We use Java, DIET on top of CORBA (OmniORB), XML, HTTP
and Java Server Pages for the web interface. We use PostGresQL for the
database. The linear algebra solvers are mainly written in Fortran
77 or 90, C or C++.

  
7. How the resources are selected:
----------------------------------

  7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent 
      in the application, and which are chosen by system
      administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying 
      the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  

Users are choosing softwares (e.g. sparse solvers) and may 
additionally select an architecture (e.g. PC LINUX or SGI,...).
Selection of the machine(s) - this is a multi-parametric
application - running the remote tasks depends on the availability
of the software, the load of the computers, considerations on
the availability of data on the machines,.... 
  
  
  7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
      by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
      of information, size of datasets?

Resources are selected partly at the expertise level (depending
on the user requirements in terms of software, size of problem,
type of architecture he wants to experiments,...) and at
the middleware level (CPU load, management of data persistency,...).
  
  
  7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?

  The resource requirements are dynamic. Furthermore, an expertise
often consists of several steps (each step is launching a bunch of
executions over the grid) and executions at a given step depends
from the results of previous steps.


  
8. Security Considerations:
---------------------------

  8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable code, 
      data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are security 
      measures used to determine access, if any?

We rely on the mechanisms that are - or will be available -
at the Corba level on which DIET stands.
  
  8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos 5,
      Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
  
We currently use some SSH.
  
  
  8.3 What are your security needs: authentication, authorisation,
      message protection, data protection, anonymisation, audit 
      trail, or others?

Authentification, data protection are certalinly the main issues
for our project.

  
  8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify your
      security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment, integration
      with commodity technologies.  

Keep it as simple and as hidden as possible.
  

  
9. Scalability:
---------------

  What are the things which are important to scalability and to what
  scale - compute resources, data, networks ?

For our project : compute resources and data.


  
10. Performance Considerations:
-------------------------------

  Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use case.

Since we are not providing computational resources GFlop rate
is not the main issue. Probably throughput is the main thing of interest.


  
11. Grid Technologies currently used:
-------------------------------------

  If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which grid
  technologies are you using or considering?

DIET middleware developed at LIP-ENSL (France) by F. Desprez and his team.

  
  
12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
--------------------------------------------  
  
  Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would like
  in an API which would support your scenario.

Something like

Grid_execute('name_of-procedure', parameters )

with both synchronous and asynchronous calls and way of testing
end of execution is fine. Additionally something sending back the
list of services that are capable of executing a specific operation
(giving the name of a procedure - i.e. who can execute GEMM ? - 
or at a higher level - who is capable of executing a matrix multiplication with
symmetric matrices ? -) would be of interest.
