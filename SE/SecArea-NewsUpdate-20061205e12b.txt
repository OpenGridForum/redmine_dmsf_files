Subject: OGF Security Area Update December 2006

Dear all,

Over the past few months, several new activities have started in the
OGF Security Area. With this Update, we would like to inform you about
these activities and at the same time foster coherency in the security area.
We hope you find this update useful and welcome any comments you have on
this kind of communication, and of course on any grid security related
activities.

    Best regards,
    the Security ADs


In this update:

  - NEW: OGSA-AuthN Charter BoF to be held at OGF19
  - NEW: Activity discussion on Levels of Assurance issues
  - OGSA Basic Security Profile Core and Security Channel
  - OGSA-AuthZ-WG re-chartered
  - Firewall Issues RG documents and group directions
  - CAOPS Document progress and sessions

These updates will usually be sent to the <security-area at ogf.org> list,
to which you can subscribe via http://mailman.ogf.org/


OGSA-AuthN Charter BoF
----------------------
  The OGSA-AuthN group is currently being bootstrapped to look at
  technologies and mechanisms for authentication in the OGSA context.
  The groups focus will be on the drafting the roadmap for OGSA
  authentication technologies, documentation of existing authentication
  community practices, and look at the issues surrounding AuthN delegation.
  The group and BoF is being organised and animated by Alan Sill of Texas Tech.

  Discussions on the exact scope of the group are currently ongoing on the
  BoF mailing list, and a BoF session will be held during OGF19. These
  discussions should result in a charter proposal being brought to the 
  community at the BoF.

  It is explicitly a part of the charter for this group to work in a
  symmetrical manner with any OGSA-AuthZ work that may be needed for
  consistency in grid services.

Topical BoF on Levels of Assurance (LoAs)
-----------------------------------------
  Ideas around "Levels of Assurance" have been receiving more and more
  attention, with the advance of federations and Authentication and
  Authorization infrastructures.

  "LoA is defined as the strength of authentication required for a service
  provider to be assured that a resource access is only granted to users whose
  identities have been verified. It reflects the degree of confidence in an
  authentication process used to establish the identity of an entity (an
  individual or a software component) to whom the credential was issued, and
  the degree of confidence that the entity using the credential is indeed the
  entity that the credential was issued to."

  Ning Zhang of Manchester University has taken the initiative to bring up
  the discussion on this activity in the OGF context.

  Examples of questions that this activity could address are:
  - What are the existing definitions of LoA suited to Grid or VO environment?
  - How to apply LoA to safeguard Grid services/resources?
  - Are some onerous registration requirements or special condition stipulations
    due to perceived inadequacies in the strength of authentication?
  - Are there any limitations in terms of user accessibility, scalability
    and interoperability?

  The activity can include discussion on how operational procedures affect LoA,
  how the various parameters and factors influence the overall LoA value in
  grid/VO environments, and come up with recommendations on how these factors
  can be taken into account. The purpose here is to consult, and to seek
  comments and feedbacks from, the communities concerned (including service
  providers, from e-Science, e-Business and e-Gov) on their views on the
  definition and applications of LoA in achieving fine-grained access control.

  Everyone interested in such an activity is extremely welcome to attend this
  activity BoF session.
  If there is sufficient interest within OGF, the BoF can also discuss how the
  activity is best embedded in the OGF organisation; it is not necessarily the
  aim of this BoF to result in a new research or working group.

OGSA Basic Security Profile Core and Security Channel documents
---------------------------------------------------------------
  The updated version of the OGSA Basic Security Profile 1.0 - Core has
  entered WG final call and is available on GridForge:
    https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.ogsa-wg/docman.root.working_drafts.security_profile_1_0/doc13561/13

  The OGSA Security Profile 1.0 - Secure Channel document draft, discussing
  how to establish a secure channel in the OGSA context, has been revised and is
  now available at
    https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.ogsa-wg/docman.root.working_drafts.security_profile_1_0/doc13560/22


OGSA-AuthZ-WG re-chartered
-------------------------

  The OGSA-AuthZ Working Group has been rechartered and now addresses more
  advanced features that are required, such as obligations, decisions based on
  action parameters, policy management, dynamic delegation of authority,
  attribute schema exchanges etc.

  The new charter is available from
    http://www.ggf.org/gf/group_info/charter.php?review&group=OGSA-AuthZ-WG


Firewall Issues overview document published
-------------------------------------------
  This "Firewall Issues Overview" information track document by Ralph Niederberger
  et al., has been published as GFD-I.083. You can download it here:

CAOPS Documents and sessions
----------------------------
  CAOPS will hold two sessions during the upcoming OGF 19 event, of which
  one is traditionally dedicated to the International Grid Trust Federation 
  (IGTF). Current draft document for example include the Grid Certificate
  Profile, a comprehensive collection of the community knowledge on what
  works and does not work in an interoperable PKI geared to currently
  running grids.
