      <h2><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Second Grid Forum Conference<br>
 User Services Work Group</font></h2>
  
      <pre><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">October 19 to October 21, 1999<br>Northwestern University<br>Chicago, Illinois<br><br><br>October 19 and October 20, Break Out Sessions<br>Co-Chairs: John Towns and Rita Williams</font><a

Prior to this conference the <a
 href="../Presentations/991019/index.html">question</a> as to whether a User<br>Services WG within a grid context was a premature undertaking<br>was raised. Clearly, before moving forward to comply with the<br>objectives set forth by the forum for the WGs this issue had<br>to be resolved.<br><br>During the course of the discussion, the <a
 href="../Presentations/991020/index.html">group collectively<br>agreed</a> that:<br>* There was a definite need for user advocacy in a grid<br>  environment, and<br>* To be most effective user services should evolve in tandem<br>  with the other WGs in the forum; therefore,<br>* Now is the time to devote resources to determining the needs<br>  of a grid user community and moving forward with fulfilling<br>  those needs.<br><br>While there was a proposal to establish an interest group for<br>this topic within the forum thereby eliminating the need to<br>attend large, face-to-face meetings, the participants choose<br>to retain the User Services WG.<br><br><br><b>Preliminary Charter</b>

As defined by the WG Chairs in a conference call in September,
the <a
 href="../Presentations/991021.html">charters for the WGs</a> will more closely resemble a mission<br>statement. Goals, objectives and milestones for the WGs will be<br>outlined in a separate document.<br><br>The following is a preliminary charter proposed by those in<br>attendance at the conference.<br><br>Foster a common understanding of user and support staff requirements<br>in a grid environment, act as a venue for sharing resources and<br>facilitate communication for grid activities between users and<br>support staff and developers.<br><br>Further refinement of the mission statement has been left to<br>be done through e-mail.<br><br><br><b>Proposed First Year Goals</b>

Quite a "laundry list" of tasks were collected:

* Identify services required by users to effectively use grid
  infrastructure and environments
* Identify tools required by staff to support the use of grid
  infrastructure, services and environments
* Define requirements and schemas for sharing user support
  resources utilizing information infrastructure
* Identify and make available through a clearing house mechanism:
   - Important information,
   - Documentation,
   - Training resources,
   - Tools, and
   - Other resources for users and support staff utilizing
     technology like the Repository in a Box
* Whenever possible, sources of these resources should link back
  to user support pages
* Evangelize developing documentation/training content by developers
* Identify user services milestones and needs for supporting user
  within the life cycle of grid technology at each stage of development
* Consciousness raising on user and support levels

Due to time constraints this list was not refined or prioritized.
Therefore, choosing the tasks that can be accomplished within a
year, assigning individuals to the tasks and setting milestones
was left to be done either through e-mail and/or subsequent
meetings.


<b>Goals for February Grid Forum</b>

* Have a finalized charter in place
* Define first year tasks
  - Establish priorities
  - Set requirements
  - Identify task teams
  - Have some preliminary work completed
