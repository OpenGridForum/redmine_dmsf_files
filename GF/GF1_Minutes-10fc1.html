      <h2><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">First Grid Forum Conference<br>
  User Services Work Group</font></h2>
          
      <pre><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">June 16 to June 18, 1999<br>NASA Ames Research Center<br>Moffett Field, California<br><br><br>June 17 and June 18, Break Out Sessions<br>Co-Chairs: John Towns and Rita Williams<br><br>SUMMARY MINUTES<br><b>Proposed Purpose</b>

As representation from the participating grids was <a
 href="../Presentations/990617/index.html">heavily<br>weighted with NASA staff</a>, only a preliminary statement<br>of purpose was entertained. Recognizing that a group dealing <br>with user support issues within a grid environment will not <br>produce standards in the conventional sense of the word, the<br>proposed purpose focuses on providing an aspect of user<br>advocacy to the other Grid Forum work groups.<br><br>The proposed purpose for this groups is then:<br><br>* Recommend and/or provide input to other related <br>  work groups:<br>  - infrastructure<br>  - wide-area event management<br>  - end-to-end performance analysis, specifically<br>    metrics<br>  - advance reservations<br>  - wide-area I/O<br>  - security<br><br><br><b>Deliverables</b>

Again, generating standards in a traditional context will
not be a product of this work group. However, identifying
required user/support services and developing a set
of "rules of engagement" is a critical component to 
forming a effective grid environment.

In relation to those functions common to all user services 
within and across grids:
  - diagnostics
  - tracking (user and help-desk/consultants)
  - system status
  - documentation (web-based)
  - training
  - consulting services
This working group will provide:
  - a set of guidelines for participation
  - a checklist of requirements based on these
    guidelines
  - an on-going dialogue between user services and
    other related work groups


<b>Short Term Goals</b>

* Identify other representatives from other grids
  - Possible candidates: Jim Ferguson, NCSA
                         Jay Boisseau, SDSC
                         Bill Asbury, ASC
  - Poll presenters from remaining grids attending 
    the forum for interest

* Establish a mail list for User Services Work Group (WG)

* Arrange for BOFs at HPDC-8 Symposium in August
  and at SC99 in Portland; arrange a teleconference  
  for those who cannot attend physically

* What we want to accomplish by:
  - HPDC-8 Symposium, August 4-6, Redondo Beach, CA
    + Possibly have a BOF at the symposium, arrange
      for teleconference capabilities for those who 
      will not be able to attend physically
    + Roll up what we've discussed at this meeting
      and send a summary to current/potential WG 
      members via e-mail or post to the Grid Forum 
      web site
  - October Grid Forum in Chicago, IL
    + Build a WG organization and have charter in place
    + Hold WG meetings to move forward with forming
      short/long term goals
    + Recruit an individual from each of the other WGs 
      who will participate in that WG and also provide
      a user services perspective; formalize the 
      flow of information to/from the other WGs 
      and the User Services WG

* Preliminary Guideline (Grid and inter-Grid)
  - Provide directory of support services and define
    the required minimum
  - Define single point of contact which would 
    "funnel" support issues to other sites
  - Define hours of support coverage
  - Publish "resources" to be provided in MDS;
    agree upon a "profile" based on individual
    site, user &amp; grid needs/availability
