\b Abstract\par
\pard\s28\keepn\plain\f2\fs20 \par
\pard\s6\plain\f2\fs20 GridIR is, in essence, information retrieval on 
the OGSA grid.  It is an effort to utilize grid computing advantages 
applied to the science of information retrieval in a unique manner.  As 
with any new system design, it is important to understand stakeholder 
community requirements in order to develop a robust architecture and 
related specifications.  This document details those requirements and 
establishes a base and context for future system architectures and 
specifications.\par
 \par
\f4\b 1.  Introduction\par
\f2\b0 \par
GridIR is information retrieval (IR) in an OGSA grid-computing context 
[OGSA-PHY].  Though core grid-computing concepts and implementations 
continue to evolve, GridIR recognizes the inherent advantages provided 
by generalized grid computing, specifically as those advantages relate 
to the information retrieval problem space.  GridIR expands on decades 
of experience with other distributed, networked information retrieval 
systems such as Z39.50 [Z3950-95].  GridIR seeks to 1) define 
functionalty and semantics required by a generalized information 
retrieval system, 2)  describe an architecture based on a particular 
grid-computing platform, and 3) detail specifications suitable for 
building and operating a complete grid-based IR system.  This document 
specifically addresses the requirements for a generalized IR system.  
It is expected that one or more architectures and associated 
specifications will result from this work.\par
\par
GridIR is about moving forward to the days of network-aware search 
appliances, virtual organizations (VO) for information sharing, 
information security at multiple levels, and large-scale 
high-performance searching that is customized for particular 
collections and information needs.  In short, it is about enabling 
today's ubiquitous information access points (Web servers, database 
servers, portals, etc.) to be integrated into highly secure, scalable 
information retrieval systems.\par
\par
We are not skeptical of the future of large monolithic search engines, 
and hold them in high respect.  However, we recognize the limitations 
of these systems, and wish to enable future information seekers to have 
choice among different information retrieval systems.  We further wish 
to make the vast quantity of information that is currently inaccessible 
to search engines available to information seekers.\par
\par
The starting point for GridIR is the scientific discipline of 
information retrieval (IR).  In IR, computer systems are used to match 
statements of human information need (a.k.a., queries) to documents.  
Statements of information need may be anything from a few words 
(typical of Web search engines) to a structured logic (e.g., Boolean 
statements) to a profile of the information seeker and her assessments 
of past documents.\par
\par
In practice, IR seldom actually presents answers to questions, or even 
specific information items (such as a table of figures, or a quotation, 
or a particular passage in a document).  Rather, IR systems present a 
ranked list of document citations in which, it is hoped, the desired 
information may be found.  IR systems may be defined as those 
computer-based systems that take a number of documents (perhaps in 
different formats) as input and build data structures so that they may 
be quickly searched for matches to queries.  These IR systems are able 
to then take queries (perhaps with special formatting or restrictions) 
as input and produce a list of documents in ranked order.\par
\par
We call the set of documents input to an IR system a \i collection\i0 .  
For a given information need, there might be more than one IR system 
that gives access to a collection of interest.  While the days of 
massive search engines have led optimistic information seekers to think 
that all the information in the world is a click away via their 
favorite search engine, even these searchers know that different search 
engines host different collections.  More experienced searchers know 
that there are thousands of different collections, different data 
types, different query languages, and so forth.\par
\par
GridIR will help to make virtual organizations' collections more 
available to information seekers.  Rather than seeking to harvest these 
collections into monolithic search engines, GridIR seeks to utilize 
distributed federated collections.  There are important advantages over 
monolithic search engines in the GridIR scenario:\par
\par
1.  Queries will be run against collections of documents with a 
likelihood of possessing relevant documents, thus eliminating a priori 
those collections unlikely to have documents of interest.  For example, 
someone interested in information about household pets might want to 
bypass databases about taxidermy from consideration.\par
\par
2.  Each collection will be customized for that collection's qualities, 
according to the desires of the collection provider.  Customization can 
include the full range of query processing, document processing and IR 
techniques such as document and term weights, IR retrieval models 
(Boolean, vector space, Latent Semantic Indexing, etc.), term stemming, 
stop word lists, etc.\par
\par
3.  Rather than seeking sub-second response times over billions of 
documents, as monolithic search engines do, GridIR systems may seek 
such performance over far smaller collections.  This will enable more 
complex query processing.\par
\par
4.  GridIR collections, because of their smaller size and locality to a 
particular collection source (i.e., an organization's Web server), can 
be updated more quickly, thus eliminating the delay among harvest runs 
exhibited by search engines.  Collectively, we expect the capacity of 
GridIR to far exceed any search engine.\par
\par
5.  Grid computing offers a notification model in which events (such as 
the availability of new content) can trigger other events (such as 
evaluating a query against the new content).  This model opens the door 
to standing queries, information filtering, and push (rather than pull) 
approaches to information dissemination.\par
\par
GridIR will provide a framework whereby existing, traditional IR 
engines may be plugged in at various parts of the architecture in order 
to construct a new, higher-level IR system.  That is, traditional IR 
systems do not typically perform as distributed engines 
(computationally or in terms of source data), but by plugging into the 
GridIR framework that engine (unknowingly) becomes part of a larger, 
highly secure, computationally and data-distributed IR system.\par
\par
Since grid computing typically includes the VO concept at it's core, 
GridIR inherents and supports fundemental VO characteristics, 
specifically the security implications.  As addressed in individual 
requirements, GridIR must go a step beyond standard service-level 
security, however, into finely controlled application-specific security.
\par
\par
\f4\b 2.  Notational Conventions\par
\f2\b0 \par
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be 
interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC 2119].\par
\par
\f4\b 3.  Requirements\par
\b0 \par
\f2\b\i 3.1  distributed\par
\b0\i0 \par
The system must be modular with clearly defined interfaces in support 
of leveraging traditional distributed computing advantages.  The level 
of modularity depends on a particular software architecture, baseline 
network infrastructure, etc.  For example, if one assumes a reliable, 
high bandwidth network, the system might support more, smaller modules 
that perhaps make the system more flexible, but more complex.\par
\par
\b\i 3.2  asynchronous notification\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a method of sending and receiving out-of-band messages 
among participating modules.  For example, given the service 
persistence requirement listed below, there may be a need for one node 
to notify one or more nodes of various events asynchronously, not in 
response to any request.\par
\par
\b\i 3.3  event-driven operation\par
\b0\i0 \par
Modules must have the ability to act on out-of-band messages received 
from participating modules.\par
\par
\b\i 3.4  service-level authorization\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a base-level authentication scheme at a course-grained 
level of operation.  A service administrator should be able to 
enable/disable access to an entire service, hence all contained 
methods.  If a user is not authorized for a particular service, by 
definition they may not invoke any method on that service.\par
\par
\b\i 3.5  index-level authorization\par
\b0\i0 \par
There should be an authentication scheme to authenticate access to a 
particular index.  There may be multiple indexes available through a 
service.  Access to each index should be configurable depending on 
proper authorization credentials.\par
\par
\b\i 3.6  record-level authorization\par
\b0\i0 \par
There may be an authentication scheme to authenticate access to a 
particular record within an index.  In some cases, a subset of records 
within an index are deemed sensitive and should appear only to 
authorized users.\par
\par
\b\i 3.7  encryption\par
\b0\i0 \par
There may be point-to-point data encryption.\par
\par
\b\i 3.8  service persistence\par
\b0\i0 \par
Each module must allow persistence of operation.  A service is 
considered persistent if it remains available for some period of time 
after initial creation in order to service subsequent operational 
requirements.\par
\par
\b\i 3.9  query persistence\par
\b0\i0 \par
Relevant modules may allow persistent queries.  A persistent query is 
defined as a long-lived query against a particular set of indices and 
its result set may be updated perhaps via scheduling or triggered by an 
event such as index update.  For example, if a new document becomes 
available to a collection, that may trigger dependent indexers to 
update themselves based on the updated collection.  In turn, an updated 
indice may notify dependent processes maintaining persistent queries, 
such that the final result may be updated in a realtime, efficient 
manner.\par
\par
\b\i 3.10  metadata services\par
\b0\i0 \par
All modules must be introspective in terms of access mechanism as well 
as semantic description.  For example, a module may provide a list of 
access methods and parameter data types via WSDL.  It must also 
describe the contents of it's document, collection, index, and query 
holdings both in a machine and human-usable manner, e.g. Dublin Core 
metadata records.\par
\par
\b\i 3.11  data collection description services\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be methods to describe an abstract data collection to a 
management service.  An abstract collection description might include 
specific URLs, spidering rules, transformation rules, etc.  A data 
collection description is considered input to a process that results in 
a collection.\par
\par
\b\i 3.12  data collection scheduling services\par
\b0\i0 \par
There may be methods to schedule periodic collection updates, perhaps 
as an extension of the data collection description.  For example, a 
data collection description may describe crawling a particular web 
site, an associated schedule might specify how often to re-crawl the 
site.\par
\par
\b\i 3.13  data collection delivery services\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a mechanism for reliable file transport of collected raw 
data from data collection modules.  There may be methods of 
transporting partial sets of data, e.g. diffs.\par
\f4 \par
\f2\b\i 3.14  document content type independent\par
\b0\i0 \par
The system must be capable of acting on arbitrary data formats (content 
types).  Specifically, the system must be able to describe and 
transport arbitrary data, but individual modules do not have to support 
that particular type of data.  For example, a collection may consist of 
text/plain and text/html files, but an indexer may invoke standard 
diagnostic services to deny support of the text/html files.  Typically, 
the required metadata services would provide a list of supported data 
formats.\par
\par
\b\i 3.15  document transformation capabilities \par
\b0\i0 \par
There may be services to transform documents from one content-type to 
another or to post-process documents based on a set of rules or 
parameters.\par
\par
\b\i 3.16  index generation services based on input collections\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a method of creating a searchable index based on one or 
more data collections.  How a collection is actually indexed, if at 
all, is outside the scope.  In practice, there is a common denominator 
set of options and parameters for most indexer applications.  This set 
should be reflected through the appropriate service interfaces and 
translated to a particular system as necessary.\par
\par
\b\i 3.17  index query services generating result sets\par
\b0\i0 \par
An index must have the ability to accept queries and respond with 
relevant result sets.  A query is a representation of the user's 
information needs, typically expressed either as simple keywords or in 
a normalized, structured manner, for example common query language 
(CQL).  A result set is a set of metadata describing documents matching 
the user query, suitable for subsequent document retrieval via related 
services.\par
\par
\b\i 3.18  query type independent\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a mechanism for specifying arbitrary query types.  
Practically speaking, a small number of query types, e.g. CQL, will 
actually be supported but there must be the ability to unambiguously 
describe arbitrary query types for special-purpose use and future 
expansion.\par
\par
\b\i minimum query type\par
\par
\b0\i0 To assure interoperability, there must be at least one 
particular type of query supported by the system.  The query type 
should leverage existing open standards.  The selected query type must 
at least support keyword queries, arbitrarily complex boolean queries, 
and attributes on individual elements of the query.  Attributes must 
include at least a field identifier in support of structured queries.
\par
\b\i \par
3.19  result set delivery services\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a method of retrieving result sets from indexers.  The 
service must allow a user to retrieve one or more ranges of records 
from the set.  Each record returned is subject to the data presentation 
requirement listed below.\par
\par
\b\i 3.20  result set record retrieval\par
\b0\i0 \par
There must be a method of retrieving records from a result set.  At a 
minimum, a single range request consisting of a starting record number 
and number of sequential records must be supported.\par
\par
\b\i record presentation\par
\b0\i0 \par
For each result set record requested, there should be a method of 
requesting parts of a record (e.g. Z39.50 element sets) and in a 
particular format (e.g. mime content type).  There is no requirement 
that a request for a particular element set/content type request be 
honored by the record host.\par
\par
\b\i 3.21  index scan services\par
\b0\i0 \par
There may be indexer scanning services, a service for browsing the 
contents of an index, e.g. words contained in an index.  A scanning 
service typically provides lists of words that actually appear in an 
index in support of better quality query formation.\par
\par
\b\i 3.22  peer-to-peer communication model\par
\b0\i0 \par
The data communication model must support peer-to-peer communications, 
for example to support arbitrary linkages among multiple participating 
(possibly persistent) modules in support of a given task.\par
\f4 \par
\f2\b\i 3.23  client-server communication model\par
\b0\i0 \par
The traditional client-server communication model should be supported.  
For example, a simple client may only know how to send a single request 
to an index and receive a single response during a session.\par
\f4 \par
\f2\b\i 3.24  merging\par
\b0\i0 \par
The system must have facilities to merge two or more result sets into a 
single result set.  The actual basis of that merge should be as 
orthogonal as possible.\par
\f4 \par
\f2\b\i 3.25  multi-lingual capable\par
\b0\i0 \par
The system must be capable of unambiguously describing the language of 
content data.  A particular module need not support any particular 
language, however.  For example, an indexer may know it has received 
German language content, but it may not know how to properly search 
such data and may issue relevant diagnostics.\par
\par
\f4\b 4.  Security Considerations\par
\f2\b0 \par
Information security is a major component for some data sets.  Security 
concerns might occur at the level of datum (i.e., a document), user or 
query source, or an entire set of data or its IR system.  A set of 
additional security challenges for IR emerge when access to data must 
be restricted in some way:\par
\par
How can the data channel be secured?\par
How may different search system components authenticate themselves?\par
What sorts of access controls may be implemented at the datum, query 
and data set level?\par
How will log files, audit trails, etc. support security?\par
How will unauthorized access or other security breaches be identified?
\par
How might IR systems that share data be tested or modeled, to insure 
they meet security specifications?\par
\par
With GridIR, issues of data channel security and system-level 
authentication are met by the underlying grid infrastrucutre supplied 
by the OGSA.  However, GridIR requires additional security components.
