2. Introduction:
----------------

  2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.  Background
      to the project is another alternative. (E.g. 100 words).

This application simulate growth of atomic species on surface. This
physical experiment is mainly governed by for random processes : deposition,
diffusion, aggregation and desorption. Its main application is wires
and gratings for electronic transport and quantun switches. This
experience is simulated by a Kinetic Monte Carlo Model which simulated
the comportement of the atoms depending on the properties of the
surface. Input and output rather small sized. Computing may be very
long (from one day to one month). Interaction is mandatory to verify
the simulation evolution. 

  2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

  not for the moment


3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
----------------------------------------------------------  

 o Source code of KMC is not distributed for customer
 installation.

 o job submission may be synchronous : the customer send a set of
 parameters and check if the result is relevant.

 o job submission may be asynchronous : the customer send several sets of
 parameters and compare a posteriori the results at the end of the
 jobs executions. 


4. Customers:
-------------

  Customers are physicians without computer science experience. They
  access the KMC application to test a surface, differents parameters
  of presure, temperature or grating.


5. Involved Resources:
----------------------

  5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
      software might be involved.

 - hardware : parallel machine / cluster
 - software : Diet, Corba, KMCsolver
 - visualisation tools : standard image tools or video players

  5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?

  no

  5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
      many remote tasks are executing at the same time?


  5.4 Describe your codes and tools: 

      KMC code is not distributed, just installed on three servers. It
      is written in fortran

  5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
      authorities, or registries.

      no


  5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute 
      or data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical 
      imaging instruments.

      no


  5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like 
      systems?

      [ ] Exclusively
      [ ] Often (say 50-50)
      [x] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
      [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.


6. Environment:
---------------

  Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
  for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the user
  environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).

  access to KMC is available through a servlet in a portal.



7. How the resources are selected:
----------------------------------

  7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent 
      in the application, and which are chosen by system
      administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying 
      the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  

      no resources are selected by users, everything is done by the
      execution plateform


  7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
      by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
      of information, size of datasets?

  by performances evaluation, CPU and network load, Diet features.


  7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?

  dynamic



8. Security Considerations:
---------------------------

  8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable code, 
      data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are security 
      measures used to determine access, if any?

      executable code


  8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos 5,
      Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?

  no


  8.3 What are your security needs: authentication, authorisation,
      message protection, data protection, anonymisation, audit 
      trail, or others?

      data protection + authentification


  8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify your
      security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment, integration
      with commodity technologies.  

      simple API



9. Scalability:
---------------

  What are the things which are important to scalability and to what
  scale - compute resources, data, networks ?

  the application is not parallelised, such we just need several nodes
  in case of multiple submissions.


10. Performance Considerations:
-------------------------------

  Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use case.

  as the application is not parallel, and the parameters are small
  sized, just the performance of the executing computer is to
  considerate for performances.



11. Grid Technologies currently used:
-------------------------------------

  If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which grid
  technologies are you using or considering?

  Diet



12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
--------------------------------------------  

  Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would like
  in an API which would support your scenario.

  It could be interesting for the server to declare functions (or a
  table of functions) for interactivity between client and server. For
  instance, the client could be able to invoc a function during the
  application execution.


13. References:
---------------

  List references for further reading.
