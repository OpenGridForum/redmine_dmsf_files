Hi,

We are sending a refactoring based Jay's proposal for discussion at the next
teleconf, if possible. Apologies (especially to folks in Japan) for not
respecting the 48 hour rule. This work was done by Dave, Hiro and I.

There's a lot to like with Jay's taxonomy. We thought to highlight, as Dave put
it in an earlier email:

> the interface (portType) factoring that takes place between OGSI and the top
level services.

In case you don't have a copy of Jay's original document (and GridForge is still
down) you can pick it up from the ogsa-wg mailing list archive. Look at
