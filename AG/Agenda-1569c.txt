Review Current State of Proposed Recommendation
Review Key Technical Changes Made:
      Type name consistencies
      Stack handling function name consistency
      Automatic lifetime of grpc_sessionid_t\\\'s
      Use of \\\"host_name:port_number\\\" string instead of two arguments
      Decision to use conservative send buffer semantics
      Added grpc_probe_or() and grpc_cancel_all()
      No order guaranteed on session IDs returned by grpc_wait_or() and grpc_wait_any()
      GridRPC error handling and types
 Review Key Technical Issues Yet To Be Resolved:
      Return Buffer Allocation Semantics
      Extent that GridRPC will address workflow, e.g.,
        Persistent data, data handles, complete solution?
        Within GridRPC WG or start new group?
