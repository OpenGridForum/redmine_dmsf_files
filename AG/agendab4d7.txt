As announced earlier on the list Topics for the agenda include:
(a) follow up on any remaining issues for GFD.129 (the SRM 2.2 standard);
  specifically, write a response to the reviewer;
(b) officially appoint Timur as co-chair;
(c) kickstart the process of rechartering the group, as agreed at OGF in
Chapel Hill. Specific topics include relations to other relevant OGF groups.

There will also, of course, be an introduction to SRM, depending on who
shows up for the session.  Also, if there are experts present, there will
be an opportunity to showcase interesting work with SRM.

If you have any input or topics on any of the above, please mail them to
the list - or to Timur and myself - prior to Monday's meeting.
