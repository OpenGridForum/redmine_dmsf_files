Conventions for for NM-WG Web Service Namespace URI

1. Introduction

It is useful to have a consistent, documented format for all the
namespace URI's used in Web Service Descriptional Language (WSDL)
documents produced by the group. This way, the relationship of the
evolving WSDL specifications to the working group documents, and to
each other, is clear and specified only once.

2. Background

The choice of URI format is based on the OASIS Web Services Resource
Framework [WSRF] URI format. Presently, WS-RF is the most important
set of WSDL specifications related to this work, therefore mimicking
its URI format is a natural way to reduce unnecessary duplication in
this space.

3. URI Specification

A typical WS-RF namespace URI is:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrf/2004/06/wsrf-WS-ServiceGroup-1.2-draft-01.wsdl

which can be abstracted to:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrf/<yyyy>/<mm>/<document>-<major>.<minor>[-draft[-<draft#>]].wsdl

Based on this, the NM-WG URI would look like:

http://www.ggf.org/nmwg/<yyyy>/<mm>/<document>-<major>.<minor>[-draft[-<draft#>]].wsdl

4. Examples

Given this textual description: 

      "The first draft of version 1.0 of the NetworkMeasurements web
      service description, published on July 2004 in the GGF Network
      Measurements working group"

the formulation above would produce this URI:

http://www.ggf.org/nmwg/2004/07/NetworkMeasurements-1.0-draft-01.wsdl
