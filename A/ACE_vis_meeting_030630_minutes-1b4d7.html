ACE Vis Meeting Notes - June 30, 2003 (Notes taken by Tom Coffin)

Review of slides from GGF8 meeting by John Shalf
need to find editors of white papers

Open Discussion

Seems like there is dual requirement efforst going on in DoE and now GGF
DoE is a US national effort we can get a broader impact by opening up
the same dialogue in GGF

Shalh: need to bring the DoE effort into GGF and vice versa

issues:
storage
networking
display devices
data models
security

these reflect the topics in the slides:
-	Security
-	Data Models/Structures
-	Transport/Serialization
-	Storage Resource Management interactions
-	UI abstraction layers

We need to proioritize these issues

Security was addressed in an earlier working group

1 - Data Models/Structures
    John Shalf, Manchester and Leeds University interested
    Transport/Serialization should be after data models and 
	structures are addressed

Large effort in all these areas across multiple groups
Part of our effort is to tap into these efforts (ie gridftp)

2 - Storage Resource Management interactions
    EVL interested
	includes Transport/Serialization
	how to manage large amounts of data

Need to bring more people into the process.

action items:
send email regarding e-science documents and if enough noise
is generated we can create a sub-email group.
