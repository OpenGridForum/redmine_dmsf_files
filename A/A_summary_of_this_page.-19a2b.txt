At GGF13, the CGS-WG hosted two sessions and completed its
mission as a working group.  The first session focused on the 
future of CIM-related work within the GGF, and the second session
focused on the Software Resource Information Model (SRIM).

At the first session, Fred Maciel presented slides explaining
why future CIM-related work will move from the CGS-WG to the 
OGSA Resource Management Team, and what that work will entail.
These slides are posted in "Session 1 of 2," and a preliminary
draft regarding some of the specifics is posted as "Resource
Management Work in OGSA."

At the second session, Susan Malaika presented slides explaining
the current state of the SRIM document, and how that work will
proceed within the DAIS-WG.  These slides are posted in 
"Session 2 of 2."
