<h2>The Background on the GGF Workshop Process</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>GGF is already established as a place for 
  standards-setting activities, in order to foster building of truly interoperable 
  Grid middleware and applications.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, 
  because Grid technology is evolving so fast in so many directions it is essential 
  that GGF as a whole not focus merely on standards, but also serve as a focal 
  point for researchers conducting advanced research, which may lead to future 
  Grid standards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As such, we need the 
  input from researchers as much as from industrial practice and experience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Although the GGF WG/RG slots are intended 
  for document discussions only, in reality in the past GGFs many Research groups 
  have been holding semi-workshop style meetings to foster research in their domain. 
  The GGF Workshop is an attempt to replace the series of 90-minute GGF sessions, 
  which had been occupied by such semi-workshop activities that had been somewhat 
  impromptu and not being well documented, with a more formal and well-planned 
  structure. Since the main purpose of GGF is to document standards, best practices, 
  and common research results, it is very important that such activities be properly 
  archived as a GGF document. On the other hand the workshop series is designed 
  to be lightweight, and to facilitate requests to repeat one as often as possible 
  if the topics seem viable, and the format remains well organized.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>As a consequence of the new workshop structure, 
  future usage of 90-minute slots will be restricted to non-workshop-like activities 
  only. The Area Directors should make a note when the RG/WG chairs submit an 
  agenda for the slots, and suggest holding workshops if they detect workshop-like 
  agendas being proposed.</p>
<h2>Workshop Format</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The GGF Steering Group has envisioned three 
  types of workshops as outlined below, but there may be other types of workshops 
  conceivable, and/or a single workshop may embody a combination of the types 
  as follows:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b><u>Type one (invited presentations workshop) 
  </u></b>would be a series of invited talks focused on a specific theme.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would encourage but not necessitate each 
  speaker to prepare a paper, which could be controlled by the workshop committee 
  and published as a GGF document. We could further have the papers collection 
  reviewed for a journal to publish it as a special issue.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p><b><u>Type two (refereed workshop)</u></b> would 
  contain papers on a focused theme of interest to GGF.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
  </span>The difference from 1. is that it would be similar to a mini-symposium, 
  i.e., there would be a call for papers and a review panel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Selected contributions would be presented at 
  the workshop and the proceedings would be published under the GGF banner, as 
  a GGF document or some other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, 
  we would consider a special issue of a journal as a venue for the publication.<u> 
  (Note: Type 2 will be instituted after GGF9.)</u></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p><b><u>Type three (discussions and brainstorming 
  workshop)</u></b> would be a focused study of a particular problem by a group 
  of GGF participants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outcome of the 
  workshop would be published as a special report to GGF as part of the standard 
  document series.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The group that proposes 
  such a workshop would be responsible for delivery of the document.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Each of these workshops would be usually either 
  one day or half of a day during the GGF meeting, with possible extensions beyond 
  that as required. The Lifesciences RG Workshop held during GGF7 spanned over 
  1.5 days.</p>
