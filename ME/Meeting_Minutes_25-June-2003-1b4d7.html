<title>CGS-WG GGF8 Meeting Minutes</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>Thanks to Andrea for the minutes!</p>
<p>Review of agenda<br>
Status of JSIM work - Lastest UML and spec, Open issues, Plans for GGF9<br>
Future of CGS-WG<br>
Other business<br>
<br>
UML Review:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>QueueStatisticalData - Clarify that RunningJobs and WaitingJobs are gauges<br>
  Desire to reflect current information<br>
  Does JobsRun as a counter make sense here? As minimalist piece of data that 
  can have metrics<br>
  added (time series analysis, etc.) - makes sense but this is slippery slope of 
  accounting data<br>
  Do we need more properties related to cost, time, ...? This is a first 
  approximation - consider this for <br>
  future release<br>
  What about a job that a user or system has suspended - This is job status, not 
  queue info<br>
  Starting job is considered &quot;running&quot; job?<br>
  When a job is running - is the job still on the queue (counted in 
  NumberOnQueue)? Suggestion to remove<br>
  NumberOnQueue in lieu of running and waiting job data<br>
  Waiting jobs - Actively moving forward and/or pending for the queue<br>
  JobRecoverySettingData - Properties into JobSettingData and Job<br>
  Don't want a 1-1 mandatory association between ALL jobs and ALL recovery data<br>
  GroupOfSystems - Replaced by ConcreteCollection, as generic &quot;bag&quot; of elements<br>
  Ellen showed updated UML and will add information regarding what properties 
  are counters/gauges</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Review of bugzilla items:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Brokering considerations - Covered by existing model<br>
  DeleteOnCompletion issue relative to OSGA lifecycle - Still pending<br>
  More job information/detail - Yes, covered by existing model - Can close<br>
  BatchJobGroup - Ellen has use case and will update bug</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Status of JSIM work:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Finalize and submit for October meeting<br>
  Peter Geitz will produce XML Schema for this - Need to work with DMTF on 
  design of the schema<br>
  and DMTF will produce tools to generate to/from MOF-XML Schema<br>
  CIM V2.8 in prelim release - July 2003 (including changes above)<br>
  CIM V2.8 in final release - October 2003</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Future of CGS:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>General charter is to enhance CIM for use on the grid<br>
  First work was job submission model<br>
  Do we disband or delve further into useful job/queue data? <br>
  What about long-running jobs and those that never finish?<br>
  Could think about these as resources and the suggested DAIS work<br>
  Seems to overlap with CIM System and Service classes<br>
  What about the DAIS work? <a href="http://www.gridforum.org/6_DATA/dais.htm">
  http://www.gridforum.org/6_DATA/dais.htm</a><br>
  Extending CIM in the areas of resources, resource managers, features 
  installed, <br>
  physical/software/transaction/security capabilities, ...<br>
  Access and integrate data on the grid - Modeled constructs (running software, 
  dbms, ...)<br>
  Don't want something unique - but common<br>
  Well-defined services, interactions and capabilities <br>
  Talking about extending the CIM Schema - and SerivceData specification as for 
  jobs <br>
  Charter broad but tasks specific<br>
  Joint working group meeting/call <br>
  Larry to collect pointers to info from DMTF and DAIS - over the next 2 weeks 
  or so<br>
  Joint call w/in a month or so to discuss <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
