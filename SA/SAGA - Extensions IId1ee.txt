SAGA - Extensions II
Azalea: 11:00-12:30 Tuesday 30th January 2007
Goal: API Extensions

Steve Fisher, presentation about service discovery API. Work based on GLUE.

Q: Is this API useful for SAGA?
A: Yes, it can nicely fill in some gaps in the current API.

Q: Is SQL really the best choice? SAGA uses REGEX.
A: Yes since the information is based on key-value pairs and the queries can be rather complex that REGEX cannot properly express.

Q: How do we know where the endpoints are?
A: This must be exchanged before hand at some point to enable the communication.

Q: Can the API be extended to resource discovery?
A: This has been discussed. Basically yes, the resources can be attached to a service. Each resource has a unique identifier attached to a service thus backtracking of the service can be done based on the resource id.

TODO; Sit off-line to define the document draft. Add use cases and requirements in one document. Target OGF 20 for deadline.

CPR presentation.
Quick presentation and history of CPR. 
Overview of CPR requirements.
Presentation of the API. Build on the CORE API, based on job and namespace.

Q: How to address the blotting of checkpoint files?
A: There are some ideas but no concrete solution to handle this. The policy of checkpoint file life time has to be addressed but might be out of scope of SAGA.

Information Service
Present the idea of the information service and some usage of the approach.
Q: How does the API looks like?
A: Show the SAGA namespace API as base. The API would be build on top of the namespace.

Q: Should SAGA stick to REGEX or move to SQL?
A: No consensus on what is better.

Write down some code example of IS usage.
