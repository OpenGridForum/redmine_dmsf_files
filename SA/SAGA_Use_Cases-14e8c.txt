    The SAGA Research Group of the GGF aims to define a high level,
    application oriented Grid API - a Simple API for Grid
    Applications (SAGA).  This document collects and describes the
    use cases received in response to an elicitation for use cases
    by the SAGA Research Group. It aims to ensure, that the API
    requirements (which are described in the next document of the
    SAGA RG) meet what the target community expects from such an
    API.
    
    The first two sections present the use case template as it was
    sent to various mailing lists and individuals who offered to
    liase with potentially interested parties, along with the
    acompanying Notes to facilitate drafting responses by providing
    sample answers to the use case template.
    
    The following section contains the use cases, presented as
    returned from the various communities, with only minor
    editorial (e.g. formatting) corrections.
    
    We anticipate that this document may get updated as new use
    cases arrive during the SAGA API specification phase.
    
    For more detailed information on the SAGA RG, its scope, and
    for related documents, visit the groups home page on

  Guidance Notes:
  ===============
  
  This is a template for providing use cases to the GGF "Simple API
  for Grid Applications" research group (SAGA-RG); these use cases
  will be used to determine required functionality which must be
  supported by the resulting SAGA-API specification, and to provide
  guidance to implementors of the API.  We have kept these two
  features in mind while creating this template.
  
  All sections apart from use case name and the description of the
  use case itself (3) may be considered optional.
  
  If the use case is complex, we would appreciate efforts to split
  into sub-scenarios where possible, for example in the use case
  description (3) and in the descriptions of customers (4) and
  resources (5).
  
  In each section we have tried to provide suggestions of questions
  to try to answer.
  
  Please send the use cases to <saga-rg@ggf.org>, or if you want to

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.
        Background to the project is another alternative.  (E.g.
        100 words).
  
    In CoreGRID WP7, task 7.3 an Integrated Toolkit will be
    designed. The objectives of this Integrated Toolkit is to
    provide a tools framework that allows application developpers
    to easily develop grid applications over an invisible grid.
    Project CoreGRID is just at its beginning, and therefore this
    use case is a description of the initial goals we have in this
    WP/task.
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
          
    http://www.coregrid.net
    
    
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
  
      Based on a desciption of the application on an imperative
      language, the integrated toolkit will be able to run it in
      the grid, performing automatic parallelization, resource
      descovery, scheduling, ...
  
      The following functionality will be required:
       - Resource descovery
       - Job submission
       - Job status notification
       - File transfer
  
  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 10


  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
   
    If the customers you are asking for are the customers that will
    develop the integrated toolkit, then computer scientists with
    background in high-performance computing. 
  
    The final users of the integrated toolkit can be any scientist
    aiming to use the grid in an efficient way with low development
    effort. 
  
  
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      At current stage it is difficult to list this, however a
      pan-european testbed with heterogeneous resources it is
      planned insider CoreGRID.
  
      The fundations of the integrated toolkit will be component
      oriented. 
    
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes, at European level probably. 
    
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      See 5.1
    
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages
        are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      N/A  
  
  
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 11


      N/A
    
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      Initially not.
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [X] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      The development languages will range between C and Java
      probably. The idea is to provide the final user with a wide
      range of input laguages, for example: C, C++, Perl, Java,
      shell script...
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      An application-level metadata repository will be also
      designed inside the same project. The information stored by
      this system can be used by the integrated toolkit to
      automatically perform resource discovery and allocation. 
    
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
    
      Not decided yet. Probably we can think of not only taking
      into account static information (CPU power, memory) but also
      dynamic (load level, network congestion...)

    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
    Probably dynamic.  
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      Initially any resource is specially sensitive. 
  
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      Some partners have experience with Unicore.  
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentication, authorisation, data protection.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      Integration with commodity technologies.
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
    Compute resources and networks.
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      The objective of the integrated toolkit is to increase the
      performance of the (sequential) application. Therefore, it is
      important that the undelying middleware does not reduce this
      perfomance.

      WAVCIS program at LSU has various sensors off Louisiana coast
      which relay real time measurements (wind speed, wind
      direction, salinity, turbidity ...etc.).  The measurements
      are displayed in real time in the program web page [1] and
      the post-processed results are archived in a SQL server. The
      datasets obtained from the sensors are then used to run
      coastal wave models in near real time, thus allowing
      researchers to validate models by comparing the model outputs
      with real-time offshore observations. Current research
      activity includes coupling of models where a model running
      over a larger area feeds output to another model running over
      a smaller region with higher resolution. For instance, we ran
      WAM [2] for the entire Gulf of Mexico region and fed the
      results into the SWAN [3] which was running for the Louisiana
      Coastal regions. Future plans include nesting of the SWAN
      model with multiple instances of SWAN models running for
      extremely high resolution and well defined smaller regions
      within the current SWAN run area. An illustration of this can
      be seen at [4]. The SCOOP project intends to integrate data
      from disparate sources and different model outputs relevant
      to each regional area displayed using interactive means such
      as GIS based web-services.
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
      Scenario 1: Simple sensor-data based Modeling.
      ----------------------------------------------
     
      -  Retrieve data from sensor database (RDBMS)
      -  Generate parameter files for model based on the sensor
         data.
      -  Stage swan model on computation resource
      -  Copy output files from computation resource to
         visualization resource
      -  Visualize using GIS enabled client
     
      Scenario 2: Coupled Simulations
      -------------------------------
     
      -  Obtain Wind data files from storage repository
      -  Stage large area WAM model 
      -  Copy the output results to visualization resource 
      -  Copy one set of output results to SWAN modeling resource 
      -  Stage SWAN model on the smaller region using the output
         obtained in the previous step as boundary condition
      -  Copy SWAN output to visualization resource
      -  Visualize both outputs using a GIS enabled visualization
         client.







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 16


      
      Scenario 3: Coupled & Nested Simulations
      ----------------------------------------
     
      -  Obtain Wind data files from storage repository
      -  Stage large area WAM model 
      -  Copy the output results to visualization resource 
      -  Copy one set of output results to SWAN modeling resource 
      -  Stage SWAN model on the smaller region using the output
         obtained in the previous step as boundary condition
      -  Copy SWAN output to visualization resource
      -  Copy SWAN output generated for selected regions over to
         the Task Farming resource
      -  Stage multiple instances of SWAN using the forcing
         conditions from the previous step over small regions with
         very high resolution.
      -  Copy output from all the runs to the visualization
         resource
      -  Visualize all the outputs using GIS enabled visualization
         clients. 
  
      All of the above scenarios will be carried out on different
      resources across various universities and research centers.
      Under such a diverse set of users it is very difficult to
      ensure a homogeneous environment for running grid
      application. For instance all the computational and data
      movement at LSU might be using grid technologies such as
      Globus, and other partners might be using traditional
      technologies such as SSH, SFTP, SCP, fork/exec etc. Hence a
      simple API is needed which allows user/modeler to transcend
      such limitations by adapting to the underlying infrastructure
      dynamically, with little interference from the user, thus
      creating a middleware transparency for the end user.

      The results obtained above will be compared with real-time
      observations obtained from sensors. Using comparative tools
      such as a time series graph comparing the model runs for
      specific parameter can be generated. Such comparisons, known
      as model validation, can result in modification to the
      physics of the model for that specific region.

      Model predictions (with a healthy dose of skepticism) can be
      used for forecasting rough wave and current conditions during
      events such as hurricanes and tropical storms. This
      information could help public safety officials give alerts
      based on variety of information including model results.

  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Hardware Resources:
      -------------------
    
      -  Large storage device for archiving input and output data
         of models (10 TB)
      -  HPC resources such as multiprocessor clusters as
         computation resources (Super Mike, Super Helix, etc... )
  
      Software Resources:
      -------------------
  
      -  GIS software for Visualization and data analysis
      -  RDBMS for storage of Sensor data
      -  Grid Middleware (Globus, MPICH-G2, Cactus Task Farming,
         Condor)
    
      Model Resources: 
      ----------------
  
      -  Atmospheric Model results from variety of models : MM5,
         WRF, COAMPS
      -  Ensemble of Wave Models : WAM, SWAN, STWAVE, WaveWatch
         III, etc.
      -  Circulation and Surge Models : ADCIRC, ELCIRC etc.
      -  Other Models : Sediment Transport Models, CH3D, CH1D etc.
  
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
  
      The computational resources will be geographically
      distributed across institutions and supercomputing centers
      across the globe.
  
      The input data stores will also be distributed across US. For
      instance the wind forcing predictions from atmospheric models
      are currently obtained from Jackson State University,
      Mississipi. University of Miami and UNC are other major
      sources for critical input data. 
  
      Visualization resources will also be distributed across the
      US.
    
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
    
      Some of our initial test cases use (4-processor systems,
      8-node clusters, 2-processor systems and single processor
      systems). Even in these test cases our models take multiple







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 18


      hours to run (13 hours in some cases). Nesting and coupling
      are computationally intensive and dependency based systems,
      hence are time consuming. Using Cactus TFM we have reduced
      the time it takes to run the nested SWAN runs to acceptable
      limits. Models are being developed to be able to use the
      larger resources they need. Currently we have been able to
      take advantage of compute resources provided by large local
      clusters.
      
  
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are

      to the WAVCIS databases.
      
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [X] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Occasionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      We use a combination of Scripts (bash, csh), C programs and
      Gridsphere portal for staging the models.
  
  
  
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks? 
  
      Users should be able to specify their own resources. In case
      of uncertainty or complex constraints, the user selects
      resource broker which negotiates the best possible resources
      for the user.
  
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      The resource is usually selected on the basis of the
      compatibility  of the code with the underlying resources
      (compiler and OS) 
  
  
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      The resource requirements are usually static , except in the
      case of special events such as Hurricanes and Tropical Storms
      when on-demand modeling iterated over short periods of time
      would be needed.

  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
    
      Results obtained from the ensemble models will form a
      critical component in making executive decisions during times
      of emergency. For instance in case of extreme events such as
      hurricanes etc, the storm surge prediction obtained from the
      models may be one of the factors to trigger evacuations of
      low lying regions. Hence security of the results obtained and
      role based availability (model developers have full access to
      the model code and the results, only a section of results
      available to the general public, all possible results
      available to decision makers presented in relevant GIS based
      clients ) of final products. 
  
  
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
  
      GSI, SSH, Globus Simple CA Planned use of Gridsphere to
      provide role based access to results and data sets.
  
  
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
      
      Authentication, authorization to ensure that only users with
      select privileges can run the stage the models and change
      parameter files.  Audit trails should be required to ensure
      that the model has been executed on trusted resources that
      have not been compromised. Due to the sensitivity of the
      results and the nature in which they will be used (triggering
      evacuations and making critical road closures etc.) It is
      highly imperative that the output data be secured in the most
      efficient way possible. 
  
  
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  
  
      The Security API that is developed should be easy to deploy
      and integrate within the existing framework with little
      modification while providing maximum functionality.  
  
  
  
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 21


  
      Under certain circumstances the models might require
      additional resources to be provided dynamically. Usually
      these are in the form of compute resources and storage
      resources depending on the Model needs
  
  
  
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
      In standard case all the simulations will be executed in a
      timely manner under a rigid schedule the large area WAM model
      coupled with medium area SWAN model will be run once a day.
      The nested SWAN model will be run every hour using sensor
      data and other model results generated in the previous step.
  
  
  
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      Current : GLOBUS, GAT, GridSphere 
      Planned : Condor
  
  
  
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
  
    The API should be very simple to use and program for end users.
    In a diverse community such as SCOOP, it is safe to assume that
    the underlying infrastructure is heterogenous. Hence any API
    should be able to deal with different architectures based on
    varied middleware. 
  
      For instance API_FileCopy(Source, Destination) would move
      file from source to destination irrespective of the
      underlying framework or middleware (scp, gridFTP..) etc.
      There by the user can focus on the task at hand (running
      models) rather than worrying about the underlying intricacies
      of the Grid.

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
  
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      Our vision is for scientific researchers to be able to
      perform visualization anytime, anywhere, using any of a large
      collection of resources, and without the need to be master of
      many different disciplines. Furthermore, we envision a stable
      environment for visualization and data analysis that can be
      used effectively by all scientific researchers as well as for
      visualization research by the scientific visualization
      community. We envision high performance visualization tools
      having the same ease of use and prevalence as common office
      productivity software. We strive for the ability to bring  to
      bear the combined resources of many remotely distributed
      computational resources upon a single scientific
      visualization task that exceeds the capabilities of any one
      platform.
  
      In the context of GGF/SAGA, the goal of DiVA is to create a
      common infrastructure that makes it it simpler to develop
      *and* deploy Remote/Distributed Visualization applications.
      Visualization application developers are spending 80% of
      their time on wrangling transport, job launch, and security







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 24


      issues.  This is particularly difficult because most the
      issues involved in transport, job-launching,  and security
      are outside of the visualization application developer's core
      expertise, so these tasks take a long time and the developers
      do a  poor job of it.  This leaves a very small amount of
      time for  visualization algorithms and tool functionality.
      We believe that such  functionality requires simplified API's
      that address these needs  (security, job-launching, data
      transport, and resource brokering) in a more domain-specific
      manner in order to present the application  developer with a
      simpler, more compact, and easier-to-understand API to  serve
      their needs.
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
      http://vis.lbl.gov/Research/DiVA/index.html
  
  
  
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g.  "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
  
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet
    points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
  
      Use case for Graphical Workflow Tools (tools with interfaces
      like AVS,  SciRun, and Amira).  This use case could also
      apply to script-based  interfaces that define a workflow (eg.
      VTK examples).
  
      Definition "component" : A self-contained program unit with
      well-defined interfaces, but opaque internal operation.  In
      the context  of visualization workflows, a components are
      connected together to  create applications dynamically.
      (interchangable with the term  "modules" in the context of
      dataflow/workflow-based visualization  applications).  In the
      context of a "Grid," persistent services that are part of the
      workflow would also appear transparently as "components" to
      the user  even though they may only exist at one specific
      location.  This kind of  merging of the concepts of
      "servcies" and "components" in this manner  violates the
      definitions of component and service.  However, from the
      application user's point of view, it is important to minimize
      this  distinction when possible.
  
      The DiVA infrastructure should be able to
  	
      1: make the data source (whether it is a file or an
         instrument) available to the distributed workflow via







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 25


         a secure socket.
  	 
      2. use performance prediction and resource availability
         information to  assign the components of the "abstract 
         workflow" to a concrete set of  resources -- thereby
         creating a concrete workflow that connects the  remote
         user to the remote data source in the most
         efficient/responsive  pipeline possible.
  	 
      3. Launch the pieces of the concrete workflow and monitor    
         them so that  the components can be relaunched in the
         event of component failure,  contract violation, or new
         user requirements.
  
     More Details
  
      DiVA infrastructure must;
     
      a) Discover available components on distributed resources.
      The list of  available components must be searchable by
      different attributes.  This  overlaps the needs of
      RealtiyGrid.
     
      b) User specifies the "abstract workflow".  This is the set
      of operations that must be performed for the visualization
      application and  the dependencies/connections between them.
      This is done using a graphical editor, but could also be done
      using scripting languages (eg.  like VTK).
     
      c) Select a file on some remote resource.  The low-tech
      method is to make remote directory listings available on a
      per-host basis.  The desired methodology would be to use a
      replica catalog service to provide a global virtual file
      space for the purpose of identifying data  files to read
      from.  A similar "virtual space" would be useful for
      selecting running simulation programs that act as the source
      for data.   This overlaps the needs of RealityGrid.
     
      d) Once the data source has been identified, the "abstract"
      pipeline needs to be mapped onto real resources -- converted
      to a concrete pipeline.  It is desirable that the mapping
      provide the best possible performance (minimizing response
      time in order to maximize interactivity... even at the
      expense of throughput).  This requires a resource broker that
      understands the execution/flow dependencies between the
      components in a workflow and can select an optimal mapping
      of the pipeline onto the resources.  It is presumed the
      resource  selector takes into account the availability of
      components as per item  "a)".
     
      e) Once the resources have been identified, the components
      must be launched/executed on the selected resources in order
      to instantiate the  pipeline.
     
      f) The components will need to establish secure socket links
      where they  are not located in the same memory space.  In







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 26


      some contexts, this may  only be authenticated socket
      connections, but other contexts require  the sockets be
      encrypted as well.
     
      g) Interactive visualization applications are very sensitive
      to QoS.  The establishment of socket connections between
      components may require  negotiation for QoS that should be
      hidden behind a simplified/common  API.
     
      h) The performance of a distributed workflow must be
      constantly monitored and components in the pipeline may need
      to be restarted or migrated to new hosts in the event of a
      failure or change in requirements.  It is possible that APIs
      developed for user-space CPR for simulation applications can
      be leverage to support application fault-tolerance for
      distributed visualization workflows.
     
      a) On startup, the application must gather a list of
      available "components".  Typically this is done by consulting
      a local configuration file to find the locations of the
      binaries (or bytecode files) associated with each component
      as well as their names and interface definitions.  For DiVA,
      we would like to support the discovery of remote modules as
      well by contacting information services  on other machines or
      a broker that locates components on all machines  in a given
      Virtual Organization.  From the application programmer's
      point of view, they want to be presented with a searchable
      database of  components (regardless of location) that can be
      queried and sorted  based on criteria such as "name,"
      "location," interface definition,  etc... Organization as an
      Relational Database or LDAP directory or even  a flat-file is
      unimportant.  The API should be able to hide these  details
      as a query for components that satisfy the search criteria is
      presented.
     
      b) The user will then select components to construct an
      abstract workflow that implements the visualization pipeline
      they desire.  By abstract workflow, I mean that the
      components simply identify the algorithm to be performed
      without regard to the location of an implementation for that
      algorithm.  So the workflow is defined without  an explicit
      mapping to a particular set of resources.  In this case, we
      will define an arbitrary workflow involving a
      - Data "Reader" that is connected to ..
      - an "IsoSurfacer" that is connected to...
      - a "Renderer" that is connected to...
      - a display window.    
     
      Please note that the "Reader" could easily be replaced by a
      connection to a running simulation code (eg. a
      remote-steering scenario), which would make component of the
      workflow "concrete".  A mixture of "concrete" and "abstract"
      components should be supported, but the most general case is
      a completely abstract pipeline.
     
      c) File Selection: The user browses for files to read using







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 27


      the GUI for  the "Reader" component.  The "reader" has not
      yet been instantiated, so  the browser is actually doing
      remote reads of directories or is  consulting a replica
      catalog.  In the first scenario, the file browser  widget
      associated with the abstract "reader" would present the user
      with a list of available machines where that "abstract
      reader" can be  instantiated (the location of this is
      determined by the service  described in step A).  Selecting a
      machine will provide the user with a  remote directory
      listing for that machine.  When the user selects a  file, the
      remote reader is instantiated on the machine where the file
      has been selected.  This is the method employed by the LLNL
      VisIT  remote visualization tool.  	
     
      An alternative and more elegant approach is to use a replica
      catalog.  In this case, the user is presented with different
      "catalogs" to choose  from.  The catalogs are abstract
      directory structures that can span  many machines and can
      manage files that are replicated across different filesystems
      as a unified directory.  In this scenario, when the user
      selects a file to be read, the application can choose from
      number of  resources rather than just a single machine when
      it comes time to  instantiate the reader.
     
      The important point here is that we need an API that will
      make it easier to browse and select files in a distributed
      environment.  Currently this task can constitute a rather
      complicated application on  its own.  It should be made
      nearly as simple in practice as the API's  we use to get file
      listings for file-selection-widgets that browse  local
      directories.
     
      d) Mapping: In this step, the "abstract workflow" is
      converted into a "concrete workflow" through performance
      prediction followed by resource  selection.  This step is
      entirely hidden from the user, but is  absolutely critical
      for proper operation.  Once the reader has been  instantiated
      (or the set of resources on which the reader *can* be
      instantiated is narrowed via the replica catalog), the system
      has enough information to begin instantiating the rest of the
      pipeline.  However, it must do so in a manner that maximizes
      the pipeline performance depending on the user's current
      performance objective. It would otherwise be impractical for
      the user to manually select resources to meet these
      objectives. Here are some sample objectives (eventually the
      system should be able to automatically switch between which
      objective function it is optimizing)
      - fastest response time when selecting a new dataset (eg.
        shuttling through timesteps)
      - fastest response time when changing a parameter on a filter
        (eg.  changing the isosurface level)
      - fastest response time when redrawing the geometric model
        (eg.  local  OpenGL vs. parallel offscreen rendering at a
        remote host)
  
      Optimizing this objective function requires a means to







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 28


      predict the  performance of each component on a given machine
      with current operating  conditions. The input parameters for
      the model can be "machine  characteristics" and "data sizes"
      (there are more potential parameters,  but this is a start).
      The output is the prediction for the performance  of that
      component on a given machine.  In addition, the Network
      Weather  Service or other performance modeling methods can be
      employed to  predict the time taken to transfer data between
      each of the distributed  hosts involved in the workflow.
     
      Once you have a performance model that enables you to predict
      the performance of individual components and network links
      (even if the model contains considerable uncertainties), you
      can employ a Dijkstra weighted shortest path algorithm to
      find the set of resources that provide fastest response time
      in Order(N logN) complexity (where N is the number of
      resources available).  That is to say, the mapping can be
      done in a fraction of a second on most machines and is highly
      scalable.
     
      We need the API to provide a simplified interface to this
      decision making system for mapping the abstract workflow to a
      fixed/concrete set  of resources.  Existing brokers do not
      understand the dependencies  between the different components
      that comprise a distributed workflow,  and therefore will not
      be able to map the workflow in a manner that  will offer
      reasonable performance.
     
      e) Launching the components:  After the mapping of the
      abstract pipeline to concrete resources occurs, the
      application manager (or app  controller) needs to be able to
      launch all of the components of the  pipeline using the best
      available means at its disposal.  While RSLs  offer a great
      degree of flexibility in specifying the job launching
      criteria, the application programmer *really* would like to
      call  "Launch("host",<the same string you would type on the
      commandline to  manually launch the component>);  It should
      be able to hide the  underlying mechanics of the secure
      launching mechanism.
     
      f) Connecting the Components Together: Once the components
      are "launched," the components that reside on different
      machines need to be  able to communicate with one another via
      network sockets.  This leads  to both security and
      performance considerations (discussed below).  Secure Sockets
      Abstraction:  The state-of-the-art use of sockets for  remote
      visualization depends on security practices that are largely
      debunked as "unsafe" by our security professionals.  Most
      distributed  visualization application developers presume
      that if components were  launched securely, the sockets that
      connect these components together  are also secure (who could
      guess the port number and startup time...  its security
      through obscurity).  This is clearly not safe, but the  level
      of effort necessary to move to simple authenticated sockets
      is  considerable (it is not practical to expect vis people to
      do this).  At  minimum, a new TCP socket must exchange an







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 29


      "shared secret" in order to  make sure the connection is
      "authentic".  If there was a single call to
      "OpenAuthenticatedSocket (host,port)", then that would be
      very useful.  Likewise, an "OpenEncryptedSocket ()" would be
      useful in other circumstances.  For instance, SGI's VizServer
      does not encrypt the socket used to convey your login &
      passwd to connect to the server (its  as bad as telnet).
      File directory listings probably should be encrypted.  This
      should just be targeted at a single TCP socket.  We can use
      GridFTP for performance, but we really need to get the
      control  sockets protected.  As you know, GridFTP is terrible
      for metadata and control socket applications.
     
      g) Communications Performance: The components in a vis
      pipeline are extremely sensitive to QOS.  This requires much
      stronger QoS guarantees  than can be delivered by the
      best-effort packet-switched networks.   Recently, there have
      been a number of major scientific network  backbones who
      support application-negotiated circuits (either PVCs or
      actual end-to-end lambdas).  The current protocols for this
      negotiation  are exceedingly complex.
     	
      The visualization application needs to communicate its
      resource requirements to the network infrastructure.  When
      possible, the network  infrastructure can provide a "lease"
      for a dedicated circuit to a  component so that it can switch
      to fixed-datarate protocols or otherwise provide stronger
      guarantees of interaction.  In the case that  the vis
      application cannot obtain a dedicated circuit, it can still
      rely on TCP/GridFTP over best-effort networks with some
      degradation in  performance.  This negotiation can be
      simplified through an API that  allows the application
      designer to declare the resource requirements  and to install
      "callbacks" that inform the application of resource
      availability changes.
     
      h) Runtime Application management:  Once we have a running
      workflow application, it is important to preserve the
      illusion that the entire application is running in one place
      (eg. make it appear to function just the same as your old
      Amira or AVS pipeline running on your desktop  machine).
      This requires that the components be monitored to detect
      transient failures or "contract violations" where a resource
      fails to  meet its performance prediction.  It also requires
      interfaces that  manage the restart of components with the
      same parameters on different  resources if a migration is
      required.  Unlike typical simulation  applications where a
      full checkpoint-restart is required, the  visualization
      workflows can have most of their state restored from the
      upstream component in the pipeline.  This makes migration
      less data  intensive, but no less complicated in terms of
      managing the state  information.
  
      Monitoring and Fault Tolerance:  There must be a simple API
      that can report wallclock performance for each invokation of
      a component.  The API can report available timers as a list







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 30


      of names and then respond to  requests for the performance
      metrics associated with each of the named  timers that are
      offered by the application.  This is necessary as a heartbeat
      that determines whether a component is still "alive" and for
      detection of partial failure (sick machines) or outright
      contract  violations (a failure of the performance model or
      machine).
     
      State Migration/Redeployment:  If it is determined that the
      component has died or needs to be moved in order to meet a
      different set of performance objectives, there must be a
      means to report the part of the  component's state that must
      be preserved for it to be restarted in the  same state and
      what state data must be acquired from upstream components in
      order to complete the components restart in the same state.
      This kind of state registration is common to many user-space
      checkpoint-restart APIs that are being discussed in the GGF
      CPR working  group.  If we could settle on one API (one that
      has a special notion of  data that can be restored from
      upstream objects rather than being  explicitly stored in the
      checkpoint), then we can reuse the same API's  to enable
      fault-resiliance for distributed workflows and remote vis
      applications.

      The target audience for DiVA are visualization tool
      developers who wish  to provide more sophisticated services
      for scientists at remote/distributed sites. The playing field
      for production-quality remote visualization tools is very
      small and in the case of each tool,  restricted to a very
      limited set of remote-vis paradigms (eg.  The  typical
      client-server model selects only a single way to partition
      the  vis workflow -- Ensight only sends remote geometry
      whereas SGI  VizServer sends only compressed images).
      Currently the effort required  to develop robust distributed
      data analysis applications is so  overwhelming, that many
      such systems fail to graduate to
      mainstream/production-quality tools. DiVA aims to reduce the
      amount of  effort required to implement such tools by
      offering an infrastructure  that handles job placement,
      resource selection, and transport  requirements.
  
      The ultimate beneficiary of this effort are the domain
      scientists who need to analyze remotely located datasets that
      are simply impractical to FTP to their own workstation due to
      size, or computational requirements.
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 31


  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Hardware:  High end computers for both simulations and 
                 visualization Data: A common data model will be 
                 extremely useful to ensure  interoperable 
                 components.
      Software:  The DiVA needs revolve around supplying software  
                 toolkits (tinker-toys) that enable programmers 
                 to assemble remote/distributed vis applications 
                 much faster than otherwise possible.
      Services:  Some of the functionality required must be                
                 packaged as services.  The interfaces to these
                 services can be hidden behind the  API, but they
                 are clearly outside of the scope of a fully
                 stand-alone  application. DiVA aims to deliver as
                 much functionality as possible without depending
                 entirely on the wide-deployment of these services
                 (there is always a back-door where services do not
                 yet exist), but  there are many benefits when such
                 services are available.
  
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes.
    
      The majority of users for supercomputing centers like NERSC
      and the NSF-PACI centers are located far away from the
      centers.  Likewise, sensor data archives are typically
      located close to the device that generated the data --
      resulting in widely distributed data sources.
  
  
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      Potentially many.  It depends on the dataset being analyzed
      and  the algorithms employed. One would hope that the
      resource selection algorithm in the resource broker will tell
      you how many resources are appropriate. The focus of the
      system is to make the launching of the pipeline components
      easier in the context of RDV applications.  Therefore, the
      number of resources employed is tangent to DiVA's design
      targets.
  
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort
        of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      DiVA will use a modified BSD-style OpenSource license.  This







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 32


      allows any DiVA components to be used in commercial
      applications without royalties.  The derivative software must
      acknowledge the source, but need not be OpenSource.
  
      There are no restrictions on what language is employed to
      write pipeline components.  Visualization developers
      typically write in C, C++ and apply parallelism using MPI or
      shmem.  Many DiVA services will  be implemented in C/C++ with
      multi-language bindings automatically  generated using
      wrapper generators like BABEL and SWIG.
  
      The first-generation components can be stand-alone programs
      that communicate via shared memory handles and/or sockets.
      The DiVA effort  is also investigating CCA component
      technologies that enable dynamic  loading and binding between
      application components using direct pointer  hand-off between
      application components.
  
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      Digital certificates are useful, but not required.  The
      primary  CA will be the DOE Science Grid Certificate
      Authority.  We would like the system to be able to fall back
      to ssh or kerberos when a CA cert is not available.
  
      The system should be able to make use of 3 different levels
      of services.
      * Standalone/Local Service Advertisement: Uses local
      * configuration  
        files to locate local, user-installed components.  This is
        a single XML file that expresses this configuration
        information.
      * Remote Service Advertisement: A machine can advertise the
      * locations of components installed to remote users via a
      * network information
        service. It *only* advertises services that are available
        on the particular host it represents (eg. the head-node of
        a cluster can advertise services available on that
        cluster).  This can be an OGSI service or an LDAP/MDS
        directory.
      * Grid: A Virtual Organization should be able to advertise 
        the  locations of all Remote Service Advertisements that
        are available in that VO.
  
     Here is a breakdown of some services identified as important
     to the DiVA architecture
     - Certificate Authority:  Of course we all need this... (grid
       don't work  without it).
     - Component Locator: A a searchable index for components that
       may be used in the distributed visualization pipeline.  A
       number of technologies already exist that implement this
       service, but a common  API to interface to this service is
       desired.  The API must be  consistent with searches on local
       indices of components (eg.  the list  of components that are
       identified via local configuration files must be







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 33


       searched/accessed in the same way as for more sophisticated
       remote  network services or even brokers that serve the
       entire VO.).
     - Resource Mapper: This is an optional resource.  The mapping
       can probably be done by the application, but it may take
       considerable time  to gather the necessary performance data
       to make the mapping decisions.  Mapping the abstract
       pipeline to a concrete set of resources may be  done more
       efficiently with a distinct workflow-oriented brokering
       service.  This distinction (whether it is a remote service
       or local  subroutine call) can be hidden behind an API.
     - QoS Negotiator: Abilene and ESNet are designing the protocol
       supporting application-controlled PVCs.  The protocol
       directs an MPLS  control-plane to set up dedicated circuits
       on behalf of applications at  their request.  Similar
       services are already deployed in CanarieNet and  the NSF
       StarLight facility.  It is desirable to have a uniform API
       for  requesting PVCs (whether they are Layer-1 light paths
       or PVC's carved  out of a packet-switched backbone).
     - Global File Space:  This can be provided by a replica
       catalog or by remote directory listers, or even by a global
       filesystem.  Regardless,  we need a single API to perform
       the directory listings regardless of  the implementation of
       the actual service. So there are a number of  currently
       available service implementations that can satisfy this
       need.  However, we wish to hide our underlying objective to
       get remote  directory listings in a simple manner.
  
  
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      The initial target is to focus on supercomputers (files and
      running simulations) as the primary data sources for DiVA
      components.  However, at an abstract level all data sources
      are peers.  That is to say, a data source that is a telescope
      or microscope is regarded in the  same way as a file that
      resides at a fixed location.  The DiVA infrastructure should
      make it easy to select the intermediate compute resources and
      computational components to rapidly supply an RDV pipeline
      for remote users of that fixed-location-data-source.
  
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      a) On startup, the application must gather a list of
      available "components".  Typically this is done by consulting
      a local configuration file to find the locations of the
      binaries (or bytecode files) associated with each component
      as well as their names and interface definitions.  For DiVA,
      we would like to support the discovery of remote modules as
      well by contacting information services  on other machines or
      a broker that locates components on all machines  in a given
      Virtual Organization.  From the application programmer's
      point of view, they want to be presented with a searchable







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 34


      database of  components (regardless of location) that can be
      queried and sorted  based on criteria such as "name,"
      "location," interface definition,  etc... Organization as an
      Relational Database or LDAP directory or even  a flat-file is
      unimportant.  The API should be able to hide these  details
      as a query for components that satisfy the search criteria is
      presented.
  
      b) The user will then select components to construct an
      abstract workflow that implements the visualization pipeline
      they desire.  By abstract workflow, I mean that the
      components simply identify the algorithm to be performed
      without regard to the location of an implementation for that
      algorithm.  So the workflow is defined without  an explicit
      mapping to a particular set of resources.  In this case, we
      will define an arbitrary workflow involving a
      - Data "Reader" that is connected to ..
      - an "IsoSurfacer" that is connected to...
      - a "Renderer" that is connected to...
      - a display window.    Please note that the "Reader" could
        easily be replaced by a connection  to a running simulation
        code (eg. a remote-steering scenario), which  would make
        component of the workflow "concrete".  A mixture of
        "concrete" and "abstract" components should be supported,
        but the most  general case is a completely abstract
        pipeline.
  
      c) File Selection: The user browses for files to read using
      the GUI for  the "Reader" component.  The "reader" has not
      yet been instantiated, so  the browser is actually doing
      remote reads of directories or is  consulting a replica
      catalog.  In the first scenario, the file browser  widget
      associated with the abstract "reader" would present the user
      with a list of available machines where that "abstract
      reader" can be  instantiated (the location of this is
      determined by the service  described in step A).  Selecting a
      machine will provide the user with a  remote directory
      listing for that machine.  When the user selects a  file, the
      remote reader is instantiated on the machine where the file
      has been selected.  This is the method employed by the LLNL
      VisIT  remote visualization tool.
  
      An alternative and more elegant approach is to use a replica
      catalog.  In this case, the user is presented with different
      "catalogs" to choose  from.  The catalogs are abstract
      directory structures that can span  many machines and can
      manage files that are replicated across different filesystems
      as a unified directory.  In this scenario, when the user
      selects a file to be read, the application can choose from
      number of  resources rather than just a single machine when
      it comes time to  instantiate the reader.
  
      The important point here is that we need an API that will
      make it easier to browse and select files in a distributed
      environment.  Currently this task can constitute a rather
      complicated application on  its own.  It should be made







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 35


      nearly as simple in practice as the API's  we use to get file
      listings for file-selection-widgets that browse  local
      directories.
      * In addition, there needs to be metadata services associated
        with  each remotely located view of a file.  That is, we
        need to know more than simply the size of the file and its
        name on remote resources.  We need to be able to expose
        information about the contents of the file (number of
        datasets stored in the file, the simulation that was used
        to create it, the size of each dataset or organization of
        the datasets in the file).  Self-describing file formats
        like HDF and NetCDF allow one to quickly retrieve such
        metadata for open files, but such data needs to be stored
        in more of a database-like organization so that it can be
        searched and retrieved more rapidly.  It is simply
        impractical to open all of the files stored in a tape
        archive in order to gather the necessary metadata to
        perform a search that locates a particular set of data
        files created by a Cactus simulation on a particular date.
      * Very little attention has been paid to managing file
      * permissions in  
        distributed environments.  While I have a uniform means to
        read data files, I do not have a uniform way to manage the
        permissions of these files to allow individual or group
        access.  There needs to be a common API for setting and
        checking these permissions.  It would be desirable if this
        API support ACL syntax even though ACLs are not supported
        uniformly across all filesystems.
  
  
      d) Mapping: In this step, the "abstract workflow" is
      converted into a "concrete workflow" through performance
      prediction followed by resource  selection.  This step is
      entirely hidden from the user, but is  absolutely critical
      for proper operation.  Once the reader has been  instantiated
      (or the set of resources on which the reader *can* be
      instantiated is narrowed via the replica catalog), the system
      has enough information to begin instantiating the rest of the
      pipeline.  However, it must do so in a manner that maximizes
      the pipeline performance depending on the user's current
      performance objective. It would otherwise be impractical for
      the user to manually select resources to meet these
      objectives. Here are some sample objectives (eventually the
      system should be able to automatically switch between which
      objective function it is optimizing)
      - fastest response time when selecting a new dataset (eg.
        shuttling through timesteps)
      - fastest response time when changing a parameter on a filter
        (eg.  changing the isosurface level)
      - fastest response time when redrawing the geometric model
        (eg. local OpenGL vs. parallel offscreen rendering at a
        remote host) Optimizing this objective function requires a
        means to predict the performance of each component on a
        given machine with current operating  conditions. The input
        parameters for the model can be "machine  characteristics"
        and "data sizes" (there are more potential parameters,  but







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 36


        this is a start).  The output is the prediction for the
        performance  of that component on a given machine.  In
        addition, the Network Weather  Service or other performance
        modeling methods can be employed to  predict the time taken
        to transfer data between each of the distributed  hosts
        involved in the workflow.
  
      Once you have a performance model that enables you to predict
      the performance of individual components and network links
      (even if the model contains considerable uncertainties), you
      can employ a Dijkstra weighted shortest path algorithm to
      find the set of resources that provide fastest response time
      in Order(N logN) complexity (where N is the number of
      resources available).  That is to say, the mapping can be
      done in a fraction of a second on most machines and is highly
      scalable.
  
      We need the API to provide a simplified interface to this
      decision making system for mapping the abstract workflow to a
      fixed/concrete set  of resources.  Existing brokers do not
      understand the dependencies  between the different components
      that comprise a distributed workflow,  and therefore will not
      be able to map the workflow in a manner that  will offer
      reasonable performance.
  
      e) Launching the components:  After the mapping of the
      abstract pipeline to concrete resources occurs, the
      application manager (or app  controller) needs to be able to
      launch all of the components of the  pipeline using the best
      available means at its disposal.  While RSLs  offer a great
      degree of flexibility in specifying the job launching
      criteria, the application programmer *really* would like to
      call  "Launch("host",<the same string you would type on the
      commandline to  manually launch the component>);  It should
      be able to hide the  underlying mechanics of the secure
      launching mechanism.
  
      f) Connecting the Components Together: Once the components
      are "launched," the components that reside on different
      machines need to be  able to communicate with one another via
      network sockets.  This leads  to both security and
      performance considerations (discussed below).
  
      Secure Sockets Abstraction:  The state-of-the-art use of
      sockets for remote visualization depends on security
      practices that are largely debunked as "unsafe" by our
      security professionals.  Most distributed visualization
      application developers presume that if components were
      launched securely, the sockets that connect these components
      together are also secure (who could guess the port number and
      startup time...  its security through obscurity).  This is
      clearly not safe, but the level of effort necessary to move
      to simple authenticated sockets is considerable (it is not
      practical to expect vis people to do this).  At  minimum, a
      new TCP socket must exchange an  "shared secret" in order to
      make sure the connection is "authentic".  If there was a







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 37


      single call to  "OpenAuthenticatedSocket(host,port)", then
      that would be very useful.
  
      Likewise, an "OpenEncryptedSocket()" would be useful in other
      circumstances.  For instance, SGI's VizServer does not
      encrypt the socket used to convey your login & passwd to
      connect to the server (its  as bad as telnet).  File
      directory listings probably should be encrypted.  This should
      just be targeted at a single TCP socket.  We can use GridFTP
      for performance, but we really need to get the control
      sockets protected.  As you know, GridFTP is terrible for
      metadata and  control socket applications.
   
      g) Communications Performance: The components in a vis
      pipeline are extremely sensitive to QOS.  This requires much
      stronger QoS guarantees  than can be delivered by the
      best-effort packet-switched networks.   Recently, there have
      been a number of major scientific network  backbones who
      support application-negotiated circuits (either PVCs or
      actual end-to-end lambdas).  The current protocols for this
      negotiation  are exceedingly complex.
  
      The visualization application needs to communicate its
      resource requirements to the network infrastructure.  When
      possible, the network  infrastructure can provide a "lease"
      for a dedicated circuit to a  component so that it can switch
      to fixed-datarate protocols or otherwise provide stronger
      guarantees of interaction.  In the case that  the vis
      application cannot obtain a dedicated circuit, it can still
      rely on TCP/GridFTP over best-effort networks with some
      degradation in  performance.  This negotiation can be
      simplified through an API that  allows the application
      designer to declare the resource requirements  and to install
      "callbacks" that inform the application of resource
      availability changes.
  
      h) Runtime Application management:  Once we have a running
      workflow application, it is important to preserve the
      illusion that the entire application is running in one place
      (eg. make it appear to function just the same as your old
      Amira or AVS pipeline running on your desktop  machine).
      This requires that the components be monitored to detect
      transient failures or "contract violations" where a resource
      fails to  meet its performance prediction.  It also requires
      interfaces that  manage the restart of components with the
      same parameters on different  resources if a migration is
      required.  Unlike typical simulation  applications where a
      full checkpoint-restart is required, the  visualization
      workflows can have most of their state restored from the
      upstream component in the pipeline.  This makes migration
      less data  intensive, but no less complicated in terms of
      managing the state  information.
  
      Monitoring and Fault Tolerance:  There must be a simple API
      that can report wallclock performance for each invokation of
      a component.  The API can report available timers as a list







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 38


      of names and then respond to  requests for the performance
      metrics associated with each of the named  timers that are
      offered by the application.  This is necessary as a
      heartbeat that determines whether a component is still
      "alive" and for  detection of partial failure (sick machines)
      or outright contract  violations (a failure of the
      performance model or machine).
  
      State Migration/Redeployment:  If it is determined that the
      component has died or needs to be moved in order to meet a
      different set of performance objectives, there must be a
      means to report the part of the  component's state that must
      be preserved for it to be restarted in the  same state and
      what state data must be acquired from upstream components in
      order to complete the components restart in the same state.
      This kind of state registration is common to many user-space
      checkpoint-restart APIs that are being discussed in the GGF
      CPR working  group.  If we could settle on one API (one that
      has a special notion of  data that can be restored from
      upstream objects rather than being  explicitly stored in the
      checkpoint), then we can reuse the same API's  to enable
      fault-resiliance for distributed workflows and remote vis
      applications.
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or
        grid-like systems?
  
         [ ] Exclusively
         [ ] Often (say 50-50)
         [ X ] Occasionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
         [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
      Our objective is to create a system that supports distributed
      visualization applications that work as well on the Grid as
      they do in  a standalone/desktop context.
  
  
  
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Visualization application developers typically use C/C++ to
      implement applications.  However, Python, TCL, and Java are
      increasingly popular  for assembling applications that use
      components that are written in  native C or C++ (for instance
      VTK supports wrapping in any of those  bindings).
  
      The services should be accessible using C and C++ bindings as
      a baseline.  Those bindings can typically be wrapped so they
      are accessible in any of the above scripting languages.

      The services/capabilities defined in DiVA do not require
      specification  of a particular GUI toolkit (eg QT vs. FLTK)
      or other library/software  dependencies.  It is meant to be a
      toolkit that enables visualization  applicationl developers
      to assemble distributed applications much  easier without
      forcing them to abandon the algorithms, toolkits, or  GUIs
      they employ to get their work done.
  
  
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?
  
      The user specifies an "abstract workflow" that identifies the
      set of components that must be run and the dependencies
      between them. From a user perspective, the location of the
      components is immaterial -- there  should be an illusion that
      everything is running locally.
  
      When a user selects a datafile to read or a simulation to
      connect to, that will pin-down the data source to a
      particular location based on the user's selection.  In a
      converse situation, a particular software component may be
      available on only one machine (eg. a software interface to a
      unique piece of hardware).  However, the application does not
      need to expose the user to locality information unless
      absolutely necessary.
  
      The mapping of the "abstract workflow" to resources is where
      the resources are finally selected.  This involves
      constructing a performance model for the the components in
      the workflow and then finding the optimal assignment of the
      workflow to available resources based on this performance
      model (an O(n log(n)) complexity algorithm).
  
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      The resources used starts with all machines that are in the
      VO and is progressively reduced by the following objective
      criteria
      - 1)  availability: Is the machine available?  Is the
        component specified in the abstract workflow available on
        that machine?
      - 2)  compatibility with requirements:  Once the source data
        sizes are  known, then the resource requirements for much
        of the pipeline can be  computed.  This criteria can also
        be used to cull the list of potential  machines.
      - 3) mapping to optimize performance:  Using a simple
        performance model  for each component and intervening







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 40


        network links, a weighted shortest-path algorithm can be
        used to select a set of resources that  will provide the
        fastest response time for a given objective (eg.  fastest
        rendering rate or fastest update rate when new data is
        read)
  
  
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      The resource requirements are absolutely dynamic.  Even a
      small change  to one parameter of one stage of the
      visualization pipeline can lead to  dramtic changes in
      resource requirements.  There are rare cases where  the
      requirements stay relatively constant (provided the Grid
      offers  resources with consistent performance... an unlikely
      event at that),  but static resource requirements are
      probably the rarer case.  Please refer to
      http://vis.lbl.gov/Publications/2002/VisViewpoints-May2003-
      IEEECameraReady.pdf
  
  
  
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
  
      Certainly all of the above.  Executable codes and computer
      hardware require protection via proper authorization. We do
      not assume that users require 'anonymous access' to any
      resource.
  
      The ACE-RG has written a document that treats this issue in
      extreme detail.
  
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
  
      SSH is the primary method used for launching distributed
      pipeline components.  We would like to continue to use it as
      a fallback where GSI is not available.
  
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Please refer to everything that Stephen Pickles wrote to
      answer this question in his RealityGrid use case.  They are
      completely relevant to  DiVA.
  
      The primary problem we faced is that most visualization
      programmers do  not have any understanding of security
      issues.  If we can, at minimum,  simplify the API calls







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 41


      required to establish an authenticated socket  and even make
      it simple to establish an encrypted socket (even for
      low-bandwidth), that would fullfill that requirement.
      Distributed  visualization applications need to meet the bare
      minimum security  standards (something that most currently do
      *not* do).
  
      In most of the scenarios we have constructed, the security
      needs primarily involve supporting proper authentication in
      order to connect  components together.  Authorization is
      primarily required if a  component is actually a persistent
      service that is not running as the  same UID as the user who
      constructed the workflow.  We try to set up  the bulk of DiVA
      valid use cases so that the components are running as  the
      user's UID in order to sidestep such cases as much as
      possible.
  
      The socket traffic for GUI events and component execution
      does not typically need to be encrypted, except in rare cases
      such as passing privileged information (encryption keys or
      passwords).
  
      Global support for group authorization is almost a fantasy at
      this point.
  
      Again, please refer to the ACE-RG security document.
  
  
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.
  
      The current GSI API is enormously complex because of all of
      the use-cases it supports.  In our case, we need
      authentication for very restricted purposes (establishing a
      simple TCP socket for GUI events for instance). We do not
      require as much functionality.  Less functionality should
      lead to a much more compact API.
  
      It is important that the security API interact nicely with
      SSH.  When GSI/PKI certs are not available, ssh works quite
      well.  While the single-sign-on abilities of GSI are
      extremely important, many have found that ssh combined with
      ssh-auth can do a reasonably good job of emulating the same
      ability if used as a last resort.  This should *not*  be
      ignored (this consideration should be taken into account when
      designing these APIs).
  
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Distributed workflows for visualization and data analysis
      applications are typically I/O intensive.  In particular,







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 42


      visualization  applications require consistent performance in
      order to deliver  effective interactivity.  (so they are both
      I/O intensive, and they  require consistency as well in some
      cases).  So, support for dynamic  provisioning of network
      resources (QoS and the like) is essential.
  
      Performance prediction is also an essential feature for
      overall application scalability.  This requires a very
      scalable means of collecting the parameters for a given
      component's performance model.  The ability to search the
      database for component attributes may be an important
      performance factor in supporting this application.
  
      I quote this from Stephen Pickles:    "Arguably our most
      important scalability concern relates to the human effort
      involved in porting and deploying applications (and the
      middleware stacks they depend on) to an increasing variety of
      Grid resources."
  
      This is the *biggest* and most important scalability
      objective for the  DiVA project.
  
  
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      a) Accurate performance prediction for components is
      essential for placing the components on grid resources so as
      to provide good responsiveness for the overall application.
      This includes both models of the components on a given
      machine/resource and the network infrastructure that connects
      them together (this can be alleviated somewhat if the app can
      negotiate a dedicated circuit).  It is entirely  possible
      that the performance prediction will map everything onto the
      user's desktop machine to get the best performance -- that is
      perfectly  acceptable.  The point is that the user will be
      hard pressed to solve  this performance problem themselves
      every time they launch an  application.
  
      Performance prediction requires only marginally accurate
      performance models to get good predictions, but it is unclear
      how to serve up those  models in a timely manner.
  
      b) Data transfer rates between distributed resources are
      essential.  API's that simplify QoS negotiations are
      important
  
  
  
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 43


    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      - gsissh, globus-url-copy, globus-job-run, GSI, XML,
        Chromium, and potentially gSOAP.
      - We intend to use the GridLab GAT for job launching, info
        services, and  file/replica management.
      - We also find SSL/TLS essential even though it is not Grid
        software per-se.
      - A long term goal is to interface to SRB for better
        integration with tertiary storage management systems.
  
  
  
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------
  
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      This is completely off-the-cuff... 
      (do not take this too seriously)
      
      // support for simple authenticated TCP sockets
      SAGA_OpenAuthentTCPServer (securityhandle, portnumber);
      SAGA_OpenAuthentTCPSocket (securityhandle, host, port, 
                                 passwdcallback); 
           // where passwdcallback gets a passwd 
           // if needed in order to  support 
           // SSL/TLS security models.
      
      // support for simple encrypted TCP sockets
      SAGA_OpenEncryptedTCPServer (securityhandle, portnumber);
      SAGA_OpenEncryptedTCPClient (securityhandle, portnumber, 
                                   passwdcallback);
      
      // simple job launching
      SAGA_Run (securityhandle,
               "string of the same damned thing I'd type on  
                the commandline to launch my job if I logged into 
                the system to do it");
      
      // Remote Directories: select a machine or a  replica catalog
      // to act as your root directory
      rmt_dir_context = SAGA_SetRoot (securityhandle, "URL, path,
      or replica catalog name to act as root directory"); 
      
      // get the number of file names so you can preallocate a list
      // to hold them 
      int SAGA_GetNumFileNames (rmt_dir_context); 
      
      // gets list of all names in the directory...  truncates
      // filenames that are longer than allocated storage
      SAGA_GetFileNames (rmt_dir_context, <preallocated array>,
                         maxnamelen); 
      
      // get all  of the metadata about the file like filesize, and







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 44


      // filetype etc...
      SAGA_GetFileStat (rmt_dir_context, <stat array>); 
      
      SAGA_ChangeDir (rmt_dir_context, <some rel/abs path>);
      
      This could go on for hours...

      Very often in certain industries, like in financial,
      bioinformatics, computational chemistry, or optimization
      there is a need to submit a set of parametric jobs which
      differ in just few parameters.  Few DRM systems have a direct
      support for this kind of calculations via an array job
      mechanism.  Abstracted layers on top of a DRM or Grid systems
      have additional ways of optimizing the execution of these
      parametric jobs.
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
  
      ...
    
    
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
      Few years ago we were involved in a large database
      calculations of different molecular characteristics for drug
      design.  It is basically a parametric submission of a large
      number of jobs doing the same set of calculations.
  
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      chemists, pharmacologists
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      There were 120 remote computational nodes and few client
      nodes with good graphics support.
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
  
      Yes, absolutely.  One of the runs involved several sites
      across USA.
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      130 tasks at one time any there was a need for doing more.
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 47


        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      The study was doen in collaboration with the software maker,
      so we had no licence needs.  The application was done in
      Fortran and C.  Part of the distributed solution was
      implemented in Java.  There was also a high troughput
      database requirement.  Typical use site would need licences
      on the remote nodes and graphical viewer licences on the
      client side.
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      ...
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      No.
  
    
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      ...
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [x] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      ...
  
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 48


  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      The runs were performed by the developers.  The
      administrators had to set up the Grid as specified by the
      devlopers.
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      It was mostly "don't care" selection of the compute nodes.
      There was a requiremnt on the scheduler node to support large
      number of tasks at the time, necessitating fine tuning of the
      OS.
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
  
      Doesn't matter.
    
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      In a non-demo like situation there is a concern about the
      nature of the calculations and the results.
    
  
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      One of the major scenarios targeted by the GridLab project is
      the ability to migrate a running application in a VO.  The
      migration process may get triggered by various means:
  
        - running out of time on the original resource
        - a more powerful resource comes available
        - a resource with more memory or local disk space is needed
        - user prefers a  different resource and triggers migration
        - migration as part of a larger work flow scenario
  
      The migrations includes following well defined steps:
  
        - trigger migration
        - discover new resource
        - perform application level checkpointing
        - move checkpoint data to new resource
        - schedule application on new resource
        - continue computation (and discontinue old job)
  
      Several of these operations need to be done on application
      level - the use cases specifically describes those operations
      in respect to an Grid API.
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
      http://www.gridlab.org/
    
    
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
    
      Following the list from 2.1:







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 52


  
      - trigger migration
          
        If the application triggers the migration process itself,
        it needs means to communicate with the resource management
        system it got started with, or with any other one which
        knows about its execution environment requirements (exe,
        input files, output files... -> job description).  The
        request basically is:
        
        rms  = Grid.getResourceManagementSystem ();
        self = rms.getMyJobDescription ();
        // perform checkpoint
        // save state
          
        
        If the application migration gets triggered from outside
        the application, the application needs to have means to
        getified about this - it needs to know when to perform
        checkpointing and to shut down.  There are many ways to do
        that - application steering like mechanisms seem the most
        convenient ones:
        
        sub mycallback (userdata) {
          // perform checkpoint
          // save state
        }
        result = Grid.announceCheckpointCallback (mycallback, 
                                                  userdata);
        
        
        - discover new resource
        
          If that operation is not performed by the resource
          management system itself, the application needs to
          discover new resources where itself can run on.  It 
          needs to provide its own job description.
          
          host = GriResourceManager.discoverNewHost (self);
  
          
        - perform application level checkpointing
        
          The checkpointing process itslef does not need Grid
          support per se, but the application needs to be able to
          announce the location of it's checkpoint files.  These
          could be put into a replica catalog, or onto a global
          file system - but the resource manager needs to know
          about them, in order to make them available on the new
          resource:
        
          app.checkpoint (filename);
          grid.replicaCatalog.addFile (replicaname, filename);
          rms.announceCheckpointFile  (replicaname);
  
          







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 53


        - move checkpoint data to new resource
  
          If that operation is not performed by the resource
          management system itself, the application needs to be
          able to mograte its checkpoint files to the new resource:
  
          grid.copyFiles (filename,    host);
            or
          grid.replicate (replicaname, host);
          
  
        - schedule application on new resource
  
          If that operation is not performed by the resource
          management system itself, the application needs to be
          able to start a copy of itself on the remore resource:
          
          copy = GriResourceManager.runJobOnHost (self, host);
  
       
        - continue computation (and discontinue old job)
  
          Both are straight forward.
          
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      The cusomers of the use case are scientific communities 
      with jobs
      a) running for a very long time (~weeks)
      b) with varying comuting demands (peeks requiring more 
         powerful resource, or more disk space)
      c) which are part of larger dynamic systems
  
      Grand Challenge Simulations are specific target applications
      for that use case.
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:

                   http://www.gridlab.org/
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      Resource Discovery and state preservation (repolica systems
      or similar) are the main requirements to information
      management.
        
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      No.
  
    
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      ...
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)

  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 55


        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
      The application is actually used in Grids, but does not make
      full use of Grid capabilities (as the one described here).
        
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Users work mostly on shells, portals are uder development.
      Programmers work on open source solutions, unix only, C, C++,
      Fortran.
  
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      Compute Resources are selected manually or automatically (job
      description by users).
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      OS, Architecture, Memory, disk space, runtime (when, how
      long)
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      Vary from run to run, but mostly static, sometimes dynamic.
      In the future more dynamic.
    
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      Data should get only accessed by owner or group.  Resources
      are not to be compromised of course.  --> standard academic
      security requirements.







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 56


  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      GSI for all communication and resource access.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      authentication, authorisation, basic data protection
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      simple deployment
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      The scenario is not bound by scalability (the application of
      course is).
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      Full time to migrate to a better must result in a benefit if
      compared to having the computation simply continue on the old
      resource.  However, on ocasions where simply continuation is
      not possible, performance penalties are acceptable.
  
      In general: performance requirements depend on specific
      application/simulation.
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      - globus based services from the GridLab project

  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      An example of a migtration in GAT is included in the GAT

      The LHCb experiment is one of four particle physics
      experiments currently in development at CERN, the European
      Particle Physics Laboratory.  Once operational, the LHCb
      detector will produce data at a rate of 4 Gb/s, representing
      observations of collisions of sub-atomic particles.  This
      massive quantity of data (3 peta per year) then needs to be
      distributed around the world for the 500 physicists at 100
      sites to be able to carry out analysis.  Even before this
      analysis of real physics data can begin a large number of

      theory.  While the four Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
      experiments have coordinated with CERN to produce the LHC
      Computing Grid (LCG) \cite{LCG}, there is still a requirement
      within LHCb to manage and track computing tasks, provide a
      set of common services specific to LHCb, and to be able to
      make use of hardware and software resources not incorporated
      into LCG.  DIRAC architecture (Distributed Infrastructure
      with Remote Agent Control) which has been developed to meet
      these requirements and provide a generic, robust grid
      computing environment.

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
     
      MC simulation/Production: User: a production manager Job
      submission: bunch of jobs Mode of submission: Organized jobs
      are planned in advance and perform a homogenous set of tasks.
      Goal: produce a big amount of data on a period, CPU bound ,
      parameter sweep application Requirements: High Troughput
      computing (Group and end user) Analysis: 
  
      <>User: Many users Requirements: response time (as opposed to
      total throughput) Mode of submission: Chaotic jobs are
      submitted by many users acting more or less independently,
      and encompass a wide variety of tasks. The input is typically
      a selection/analysis algorithm to be applied to a very large
      dataset(i/o bound). Users can submit jobs of this kind at any
      time, simultaneously asking for the common input datasets.
  
  
    4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
    
      ...

  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Resources: Standart cluster accessible trough a batch system,
      grid system (e.g LCG) Software : linux and python interpreter
    
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
  
      Yes. spread over the world
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      60 computing sites representating something like 5000 nodes
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      Dirac use no license and it's a free project.  DIRAC can be
      decomposed into four sections: Services, Agents, Resources,
      and User Interface. The core of the system is a set of
      independent, stateless, distributed services. The services
      are meant to be administered centrally and deployed on a set
      of high availability machines. Resources refer to the
      distributed storage and computing resources available at
      remote sites, beyond the control of central administration.
      Access to these resources is abstracted via a common
      interface. Each computing resource is managed autonomously
      by an Agent, which is configured with details of the site and
      site usage policy by a local administrator. The Agent runs
      on the remote site, and manages the resources there, job
      monitoring, and job submission.  An Agent can be deployed on
      a gatekkeeper of a large cluster or just on a single worker
      node of the LCG grid. PBS, LSF, BQS, Condor, LCG, Globus can
      be used as the DIRAC computing resources.
  
      The User Interface allows access to the Central Services, for
      control, retrieval, and monitoring of jobs and files. It
      consists of a small set of distributed stateless Core
      Services, which are centrally managed, and Agents which are
      managed by each computing site.
  
      The current implementation has been written largely in
      Python, due to the rich set of library modules available, its
      object oriented nature, and the ability. The workload







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 61


      management system (WMS) components use XML-RPC and instant
      messaging Jabber protocols for communication which increases
      the overall reliability of the system. The jobs handled by
      the WMS are described using Classad library which facilitates
      the interoperability with other grids.  to rapidly prototype
      design ideas.   
  
      For all Service and Job state persistence, a MySQL database
      is used.
   
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      ...
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      Usually some mass storage (HPSS) are used in several sites
      called "Tiers 0".
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [X] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
   
      keeping the implementation in Python, Clients and Agents only
      require a Python interpreter for installation.  These
      components which are distributed to the users and computing
      centers are also very small --- less than one megabyte
      compressed --- which further facilitates a rapid installation
      or update of the software.  Software required for jobs is
      installed in a paratrooper approach, which is to say that
      each job installs all software it requires, if it is not
      already available.  This software is cached and made
      available for future jobs run by the same Agent.
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 62


  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
     
   When the user submit their jobs they specify their requirement
   (data need, CPU required, and so on), then the system tries to
   find the resource which match well theses requirements.
  
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
    
      DIRAC uses a 'pull' paradigm where Agents request tasks
      whenever they detect their local resources are available.
      The collaborating central Services allow new components to be
      plugged in easily. These Services can perform functions such
      as scheduling optimization, task prioritization, job
      splitting and merging, to name a few.
   
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
   
      The resource requirement are both of them static , e.g. for
      the cpu requirement and dynamic for the data requirement in
      regard with where the data are avalaible.
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      acces to the ressources must be secure and the tracability
      must be guarantee. The system adminitrator woudl like to know
      who has done something in the grid. This information is also
      to do the accounting of the system
  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      No.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
    
      , authorisation,
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 63


    
      are looking now the integration with web services
      technologies based on apache3, mod python, grid site which
      should provides the gsi security infrastructure.
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
    
      system needed to be quickly and easily deployed across fourty
      or more sites, with little effort from local site
      administrators, either for installation or maintenance.
      Similarly, users needed to be able to access the system from
      anywhere, with a minimal set of tools.  The need to support
      intense computational load also required the system to be
      responsive and scalable, supporting over 10,000 simultaneous
      executing jobs, and 100,000 queued jobs.The final system must
      be able to deal with 30000 cpus and to manipulate store and
      analyse something like 2 peta per year.
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      All Client/Service and Agent/Service communication is done
      via XML-RPC calls, which are lightweight and fast.
      Furthermore, instantiating and exposing the API of a Service
      as a multi-threaded XML-RPC server in Python is extremely
      straight forward and robust.  We are lookink now to use
      apache+mod python with a security infrastructure that have a
      real web services and oriented services architecture.
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      Genomics acquiring programs such as full genomes sequencing
      projects are producing greater amounts of data. The analysis
      of these raw biological data require very large computing
      resources. Functional sites and signatures of protein are
      very useful for analyzing these data or for correlating
      different kind of existing biological data. These methods are
      applied, for example for identification and characterization
      of the potential functions of new sequenced proteins,
      clusterization in protein family of the sequences contained
      in international databanks, and so on.
  
      The Grid Protein Pattern Scanning-GriPPS project (granted by
      the french programACI GRID 2002) aims to develop and adapt
      these bioinformatic algorithms so that they can exploit the
      underlying grid infrastructure. Models of those algorithms
      will be devised to be able to foresee their behavior on a
      grid platform and proposals will be written to adapt other
      bioinformatic algorithms to the grid. Within this context, we
      propose to study such algorithms to identify the constraints
      related to the biological applications and to determine their
      granularity and the possible parallelization schemes that can
      be applied to them.

        Background to the project is another alternative.
        (E.g. 100 words).
  
      New developments in the field of theoretical chemistry
      require the computation of numerous Molecular Potential
      Energy Surfaces (PESs) to generate adequate quantum force
      field parameters. Because workstations alone cannot fulfill
      the requirements of these modern chemical advancesy, we have
      tackled this problem using several up-to-date computer
      science technology such as a GridRPC middleware (DIET),
      molecular databases, script interfacing...
  
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
  
      ...
  
  
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
  
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
  
      We have decided to use the
      DIET\footnote{\url{http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/DIET}}
      (D\istributed Interactive Engineering Toolbox) middleware to
      port our application on our  grid. The DIET environment
      works under the gridRPC. 
  
      The application needs to store information about the
      computations that have to be performed and the results.It is
      required to access to the information very often and very
      efficiently.  Therefore, we have decided to use MySQL
      databases for storing the information.
  
      Since the DIET API is in the C/C++ language, some python
      scripts are used to interface DIET with the databases. These
      scripts are used to extract requests and to filter and store
      results in the databases.  Requests and results are
      transferred in XML files.
  
      On the computing side, python scripts are used to parse XML
      requests files and call the quantum chemistry (QC) solver
      with the right arguments.  Several solvers can be used to
      compute \abinitio or semiempirical energies (\ie, quantum
      chemical energies, or QCEs).  Each time a compute node
      register to the DIET environment, it tells DIET which kind of
      operation it is able to perform.

  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      The customer give a set iof molecule conformation and the
      system computes teh Potential Energy Surface of all the
      system. Then the system is able to fit structural chemistry
      parameters. 
  
  
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      A PC farm and a PC server linked by a network.
  
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
  
      Not yet, but it could as soon as we will be able to bypass
      firewall.
  
  
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      So far we have 8 PC, but we could have many more.  There is
      at most one task running per resources at the same time.
  
  
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort 
        of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is 
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source 
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages 
        are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g. 
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      We use the DIET middleware (opensource) a mysql Database.
      The code is in C sole script are in Python.
  
  
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      None

    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute 
        or data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical 
        imaging instruments.
  
      None
  
  
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like 
        systems?
  
        [X] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
  
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      ...
  
  
  
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      No ressources are selected by the user. Resources are Server
      that register to the environement. 
  
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      We use the GridRPC model but run the application under the
      pull mode (desktop grid model).
  
  
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      static

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
  
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      This application simulate growth of atomic species on
      surface. This physical experiment is mainly governed by for
      random processes : deposition, diffusion, aggregation and
      desorption. Its main application is wires and gratings for
      electronic transport and quantun switches. This experience is
      simulated by a Kinetic Monte Carlo Model which simulated the
      comportement of the atoms depending on the properties of the
      surface. Input and output rather small sized. Computing may
      be very long (from one day to one month). Interaction is
      mandatory to verify the simulation evolution. 
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
      not for the moment
  
  
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
      - Source code of KMC is not distributed for customer
        installation.
  
      - job submission may be synchronous : the customer send a set
        of parameters and check if the result is relevant.
  
      - job submission may be asynchronous : the customer send
        several sets of parameters and compare a posteriori the
        results at the end of the jobs executions. 
  
  
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      Customers are physicians without computer science experience.
      They access the KMC application to test a surface, differents
      parameters of presure, temperature or grating.

  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 84


  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      no resources are selected by users, everything is done by the
      execution plateform
  
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability

  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 85


  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      the application is not parallelised, such we just need
      several nodes in case of multiple submissions.
  
  
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.

  --------------------------------------------  
  
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      It could be interesting for the server to declare functions
      (or a table of functions) for interactivity between client
      and server. For instance, the client could be able to invoc a
      function during the application execution.

  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code that models an
      ensemble of particles in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state.
      It can model atomic, polymeric, biological, metallic, or
      granular systems using a variety of force fields and boundary
      conditions.
  
      LAMMPS runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
      machines, but is designed for parallel computers. It will run
      on any parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the
      MPI message-passing library. This includes distributed- or
      shared-memory parallel machines and Beowulf-style clusters.
  
      LAMMPS can model systems with only a few particles up to
      millions or billions.  The current version of LAMMPS is
      written in C++.  In the most general sense, LAMMPS integrates
      Newton's equations of motion for collections of atoms,
      molecules, or macroscopic particles that interact via short-
      or long-range forces with a variety of initial and/or
      boundary conditions. For computational efficiency LAMMPS uses
      neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles.  The lists
      are optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive
      at short distances, so that the local density of particles
      never becomes too large. On parallel machines, LAMMPS uses
      spatial-decomposition techniques to partition the simulation
      domain into small 3d sub-domains, one of which is assigned to
      each processor. Processors communicate and store "ghost" atom
      information for atoms that border their sub-domain. LAMMPS is
      most efficient (in a parallel sense) for systems whose
      particles fill a 3d rectangular box with roughly uniform
      density.

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
  
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .

        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      This parallel application is based on a stereo vision
      algorithm. We focus on the particular stereo vision problem
      of accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) reconstruction
      from a pair of images of the SPOT satellite. The input data
      consists in two images of a particular region taken from
      different points of view. From these images, we extract the
      three-dimensional information by finding couples of
      corresponding points and computing 3D coordinates using
      camera information. The input data size may be very large
      especially from satellite imagery which produces 6000 x
      6000-pixel images, involving important computation times as
      well as very large memory demand.
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
      http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~gridasp/aci_appli2.html
  
  
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
      - Source code of DEM is not distributed for customer
        installation. They just access a DEM server to submit their
        problem. 
  
      - Datas needed for a job submission are six files plus scalar
        and boolean values. 
  
      - job submission may be synchronous : the customer send a set
        of parameters and check if the result is relevant.
  
      - job submission may be ssynchronous : the customer send
        several sets of parameters and compare a posteriori the
        results at the end of the jobs executions. 
  
      - result of a job submission is an image file.
  
  
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      Customers are geologists without computer science experience.
      They mesure the geological evolution of an area, somethime in
      place with just a laptop and GSM connection. They need to
      remotly access the server.

    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      This research project is about robot control across a Grid,
      first step toward a Grid solution for generic process
      control. A Grid can provide a homogeneous environment for
      computers from different sites. It can choose the most
      suitable machine for every task and transparently run
      redundant computations for critical operations, adding fault
      tolerance to the remote control.
  
      built a Grid between France and Italy and successfully
      controlled a navigating robot and a robotic arm. Our Grid is
      based on the GridRPC paradigm, the DIET environment and an
      IPSEC-based VPN. We turned some modules of robotic
      applications in Grid services. Finally we developed a
      high-level API for specializing the GridRPC paradigm for our
      purposes, and a semantics for easy adding new Grid services.

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
    
      - Customer uses a laptop+wifi to control a physical process







  2005-04-22 16:38        === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 99


        and to be able to walk around during complex experiment. He
        runs computations on some powerful computing servers in a
        Grid, and does not care of the choice of the servers. 
  
      - Customer runs a complex process control (physical process)
        composed of many modules. Each module is a service and a
        Grid middleware manage these services. The RobGrid API
        allows a smart programming of the application, running
        critical services several times in parallel (redundant
        computation) to ensure these operations will succeed.
  
      - Customer controls several physical processes and use
        several computers, but avoid to devote computers to
        particular processes. Any machine can be used to control a
        process, and a Grid middleware manages the matching of the
        resources and the process currently under control.
  
      - Customer needs to control a process in a hostil
        environment, with very few computing resources around. He
        needs to use remote computing resources. The API allows to
        easily write applications that overlap the "physical times"
        (time to move some part of the physical processes) with
        some communication times across Internet, and to access
        parallel computers when extra CPU power is needed.
    
  
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      - Customers of this use case can be computing researchers
        that aim to develop Grid solutions for process control.
        They can use our Grid and our API to implement their
        distributed and remote control.
    
      - Customers can be "end users": people that need to control
        some physical processes from a distant location, or to
        control a lot of processes spread in the world and a lot of
        computing resources at different locations.
  
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      - 2 robots (one mobile robot and a robotic arm)
      - 1 cluster of 8 machines
      - 3 4-processor PC

      - 1 firewall PC for IPSEC VPN management on the main site
      - 1 PC on each other site (3 other sites)
      - 1 bi-processor PC : grid server for DNS, Corba Name server,







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 100


        ...
    
      - DIET & OmniORB
      - IPSEC VPN
      - NONO & Koala libraries developed at Supelec (in
        collaboration with Loria) for robot management
      - RobGrid API (developed at Supelec)
      - Some Robotic applications developed at Supelc (in
        collaboration with ENSAM)
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes : 
      - University of Salerno : one grid computing server
      - 1 PC on Metz network ("wanadoo" provider)
        - 1 PC on Metz network ("free" provider)
        - Supelec Metz campus : 2 robots and the rest of the
          computing resources
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      We have run until 18 services in the same benchmark (during
      the same application execution) We have run our application
      on 3 sites (simultaneously) among the 4 availables We have
      run our 2 robots simultaneously, and 18 services on 5
      computing servers, more the firewall, the gateway and the
      computing server of the grid (DNS, ...), using 3 sites.
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      Usually we use gcc and g++, we write C/C++ code, and all are
      open source codes. We use different tools to write UML
      documentation (including Rational Rose).
  
      We write and use source code and some pre-compiled versions
      of DIET.
  
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      We have installed our VPN using certificates, and sometimes
      "secret strings" (when pb happen with certificates).

    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      YES : 2 robots. One mobile robot: Koala robot of K-Team
      company, and one robotic arm from "Francaise
      d'instrumentation".
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems ?
  
        [X] Exclusively ..... 
            BUT: it was just a testbed for the development of 
            our RobGrid API
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Linux, 
      IPSEC VPN, OmniORB COrba Bus, DIET, 
      Nono lib, Koala lib : robot management
      RobGrid API : management of robot on the Grid, allows to 
                    easily write Grid services for robot control
      Robotic application : navigation, landmark detection, 
                    self-localization, lightness measurement
  
      We shut down some services to simulate failures and to test
      our fault-tolerance mechanisms based on redundant Grid
      computations,and we measure execution times.
  
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      The robot(s) is(are) inerent to the application.  For the
      moment the user choose the machines to use! But in the next
      version the user should choose only the sites to use for
      redundant computations, and the Grid middleware should choose
      the machines to use on these sites.







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 102


    
      The choice depends on the availability of the machines.
      Usually we do not look for powerful machine,s but for
      available machines for redundant computations. Ex: during the
      day machines at Metz on Internet and on the network of
      private provider (wanadoo, free, ...) and with limited Bw
      (128Kb/s, 512Kb/s) are more interesting than machines at the
      University of Salerno. During the night it is the opposite.
  
      We run many services (ex: 18 services, corresponding to 8
      different services, and some services run redundantly). So we
      need many machines, but each machine can be a classical PC or
      a small multiprocessor machine. 
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      Main criteria are the OS and the availability of the machines
      (have different availability at different moment of the day),
      and the speed of the network to reach these machines. 
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      Dynamic: depends on the date (some machines aer needed during
      the day, and others during the night, for example), depends
      on the possible failures of the machines and of the network
      (we choose available" and "reachable"  machines).
    
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      Main sensitive point: if program and/or sensor output values
      are modified, then the robot can be damaged (physical
      damage!). So we need security.  We have deployed a secure
      VPN: IPSEC with gateway and firewall, with data encryption,
      authentication (certificate based), limited login on our Grid
      ... "Full IPSEC install".
  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      IPSEC, ssh and certificates.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 103


        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      authentication, authorisation, message protection, data
      protection.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      Simple deployment: IPSEC is integrated to Linux, but remains
      difficult to install on many sites. We succeeded on Salerno
      and Supelec. We failed on Potenza and Bucarest (UPB). We
      succeeded on wanadoo and free networks, but each time the
      machines were ebooted they changed their IP (dynamic IP on
      these private provider networks) and VPN config had to be
      updated ....
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      For scalability experiment we need more robots (more physical
      processes to control), located on different sites ... and we
      need robotician/automatician partners to improve robotic
      applications.
  
      We need more sites that accept to deploy IPSEC (sometimes
      some change have to be done in the site security
      configuration).
  
      Of course we need more PC, but seems not a pb. 
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      We have time constraints : when the local machines fail or
      are overloaded, we use remote machines (remote machines take
      the control automatically) and we have to deal with Internet
      communication times. We send camera image, infra red sensor
      output. When application slow down we can observe the robot
      slow down.
  
      We use to overlap communication time with computation times
      and with mechanical times. Each grid service is a kind of
      pipeline across Internet.
  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 104


      At the end we measure execution time, global execution times
      on 24h (one benchamrk each 15 minutes, to not burn the robot!
      we have burnt 2 motors and one robot ...). We can observe
      that if services are on different machines, when machines
      fails, not all service fail, a,d so the global slowdown of
      the application is limited. Many services continue to run on
      local machines, and remote machines control only some parts
      of the application. Slow don is limited to these parts.
      Stategy seems OK. 
  
      We try to learn what site is a good candidate to host
      redundant services at 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h, 24h 4h ... 
  
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      We used to use a VPN based middleware and a GridRPC
      programming model, then we build our RobGridAPI : kind of
      distributed and remote object framework (like Java RMI). 
  
      But in the future we would like to use a GridRPC formalism on
      a "Globus-like" middleware, to test another technology than
      VPN. We would like to test a middleware that does not need to
      have accounts on each site.
  
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      GridRPC was Ok, but we would like it would be easier to
      initialize the system, to exchange data like camera images.
      We are experimenting ProCative (other project), the API seems
      interesting, bu we pefer C/C++ to deal with drivers of robot
      devices.
  
      RobGrid is RMI-like, so I think a GridRMI, in place of
      GridRPC could be interesting for our application. Seems more
      adaped to our use case.

        Background to the project is another alternative. 
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      The goal of the Grid-TLSE project is to design an expert site
      for sparse matrices. This web site provides tools and
      software for sparse matrices. It also includes a bibliography
      on sparse matrix software and collections of sparse matrices.

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 107


    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
    
      Example of scenario : determination of the best symmetric
      permutation
  
    	- Identify all the symmetric permutations available
  	    on the TLSE grid
  		    for each symmetric permutation
  		       do
  		          select one serve offering the symmetric permutation
  		          send the matrix to the server
  		          start calculation
  		          recover the results
  		       done
   	  - Determine the symmetric permutation that provided
  	    the minimun fill-in.
  	  - Send back the answer to the user
      
  
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
     There are two classes of users :
     - expert users that are deploying sparse linear algebra
       sofware over our grid and proceed to experiments aiming at
       comparing, debugging, ... their sofwares.
     - non-expert users that are mainly interested by uploading
       their matrices and determine which solver or which machine
       is the most efficient in terms of memory, execution time,...
       for their problems.
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Softwares : large number of sparse softwares . A large
      database that hold description of the solvers, the computers
      available, informations related to the users, results of
      experiments and matrix collections.  The TLSE gird will
      involve a wide range of computers from PC up to large
      parallel computers so that users may proceed to a wide range







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 108


      of experiments.
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      At national level and we may anticipate utilization of
      computers in foreign countries.
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      Typically we anticipate tens up to hundreds.
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      The sparse linear algebra software is either open source or
      available in libraries such as Harwell Subroutine Library.
      The code we deveoped is open source. DIET is also publically
      available.
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      The expert site only requires a on-line registration to
      identify users.
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      NO
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [x] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 109


  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      We use Java, DIET on top of CORBA (OmniORB), XML, HTTP and
      Java Server Pages for the web interface. We use PostGresQL
      for the database. The linear algebra solvers are mainly
      written in Fortran 77 or 90, C or C++.
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      Users are choosing softwares (e.g. sparse solvers) and may
      additionally select an architecture (e.g. PC LINUX or
      SGI,...).  Selection of the machine(s) - this is a
      multi-parametric application - running the remote tasks
      depends on the availability of the software, the load of the
      computers, considerations on the availability of data on the
      machines,.... 
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      Resources are selected partly at the expertise level
      (depending on the user requirements in terms of software,
      size of problem, type of architecture he wants to
      experiments,...) and at the middleware level (CPU load,
      management of data persistency,...).
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      The resource requirements are dynamic. Furthermore, an
      expertise often consists of several steps (each step is
      launching a bunch of executions over the grid) and executions
      at a given step depends from the results of previous steps.
  
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      We rely on the mechanisms that are - or will be available -







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 110


      at the Corba level on which DIET stands.
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      We currently use some SSH.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentification, data protection are certalinly the main
      issues for our project.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      Keep it as simple and as hidden as possible.
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      For our project : compute resources and data.
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      Since we are not providing computational resources GFlop rate
      is not the main issue. Probably throughput is the main thing
      of interest.
  
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      DIET middleware developed at LIP-ENSL (France) by F. Desprez
      and his team.
  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 111


    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      Something like
  
        Grid_execute('name_of-procedure', parameters )
  
      with both synchronous and asynchronous calls and way of
      testing end of execution is fine. Additionally something
      sending back the list of services that are capable of
      executing a specific operation (giving the name of a
      procedure - i.e. who can execute GEMM ? - or at a higher
      level - who is capable of executing a matrix multiplication
      with symmetric matrices ? -) would be of interest.

        (E.g. 100 words).
   
      MDDB is a project to build an integrated system for executing
      and analyzing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The
      goal is to harness commodity MD codes, commodity database
      products, and commodity distributed computing toolkits into
      an integrated system which permits the efficient distributed
      calculation of molecular dynamics trajectories, storage of
      primary results in a stable archive, analysis of primary and
      derived data, and visualization of resulting data. There are
      currently several kinds of simulation algorithms we currently
      employ (or would like to implement) to generate ensembles of
      molecular dynamics trajectories for estimation of
      thermodynamic or kinetic observables:
  
      1: replica-exchange: N iterations of M independent replicas
         are carried out with a Metropolis Monte Carlo-like
         exchange trial using potential energy between iterations.  
        
      2: Dynamic evolution from a prepared state: Often, the
         statistical dynamics of evolution from a prepared state
         (such as an initial configuration or phase space cell) or
         number of states (when estimating transition matrices) is
         of interest [7, 8]. In this case, a number of trajectories
         of moderate length (10-100 ps) are generated from an
         initial ensemble of starting states and simulated
         independently.  
        
      3: Transition path sampling: A Monte Carlo simulation in path
         space is conducted.  
        
      4: Hybrid Monte Carlo: sampling from the canonical
         distribution is achieved by conducting a number of short
         MD simulations in sequence. Each simulation begins with
         selection of a new momentum from the Maxwell-Boltzmann
         distribution, integration of the molecular dynamics
         trajectory, and then a Metropolis acceptance step using
         the change in total energy from initial and final steps of
         the trajectory.  
        
      5: Wang-Landau sampling. In Wang-Landau sampling [4, 5],
         trajectories are generated with random initial velocities
         as in hybrid Monte Carlo, but the acceptance of the
         trajectory is based on statistics accumulated in the form
         of a transition matrix containing counts of the generated
         transitions. The acceptance criterion attempts to produce
         a random walk in the coordinates of interest (e.g.
         potential energy, an intramolecular distance, etc.).
  
      The MMDB use case states requirements for a number of
      features which are not anticipated to be implemented by SAGA,
      including:
  
      * Direct relational database access Implementation framework
      * for higher level algorithms Application-domain specific
      * data processing

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
      The MDDB project proposed a task scheduling system which
      duplicated the functionality provided by typical distributed
      computing toolkits. The project assumes a heterogeneous
      architecture, independent storage computing environment and
      uses it to implement a master/worker workload distribution
      system. Individual "task units" (typically single MD
      simulations of 1-100ps) are farmed out to workers by the
      master which manages the high-level simulation algorithm
      details. Typical operations performed by the master
      application are
  
      * Discover resource Submit job to resource Move input files
      * from storage to resource Run job Move output files from
      * resource to storage High-level simulation algorithm details
      * such as Metropolis Monte
        Carlo exchange trials
  
      Following the primary simulation runs managed by the master,
      post-processing tasks are carried out to produce derived data
      which is then visualized. Many postprocessing steps consume
      large amounts of CPU, memory and storage and can also be
      adapted to distributed computing frameworks. The
      post-processing steps themselves often require advanced data
      access methods (transactional, relational) in addition to
      direct file I/O.
  
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      This use case is currently implemented in an ad-hoc fashion
      across many academic research labs using molecular dynamics
      for protein folding and other structural biology endeavors.
  
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Hardware: 
        - Cluster connected with 100BaseT or gigabit Ethernet
        - Large RAID storage system
      Software: 
        - Molecular dynamics engine such as AMBER, CHARMm or NAMD

          in
        - Related data-specific pre- and post-processing
          applications tools -Generic plotting and data analysis
          tools
        - Scripting languages to automate workflow
        - Batch queuing system
      Data:
        - Starting structures either from experimental structural 
          biology or theoretical models
        - Chemical force field
    
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
  
      The MDDB document specific lists a collection of
      geographically distributed compute resources that are used in
      the existing implementation of this use case, including local
      academic clusters and nationally funded supercomputers.
  
  
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      In the current implementation, limited by the distributed
      computing framework, only a single local academic cluster
      resource is utilized in a single run.
  
  
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort 
        of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is 
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source 
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages 
        are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g. 
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      Molecular dynamics engines (written in C, C++, or Fortran)
      are licensed from academic research groups either with a GPL,
      or BSD-like license, or for a fee with a custom academic
      license. In some cases the source code is used to compile a
      binary, in other cases, provided binaries are used.  Custom
      workflow and data analysis solutions are normally implemented
      using Java or Python.  A number of general purpose data
      analysis tools available under the GPL or BSD licenses are
      used.
  
   
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
   
      Currently, no information sources such as CAs or registries
      are used, although it would be desirable to use them if they
      were available.
  
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or 
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical 







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 116


        imaging instruments.
  
      Not directly.
      
  
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
    ...
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like 
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [X] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
        
    
  
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      The application is launched from a shell environment, using
      scripting language tools to manage the distributed
      computations.
    
  
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent 
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying 
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      Currently, all resources are explicitly selected at the
      beginning of run time by the user (direct submission to a
      batch queuing system), at the discretion of the system
      administrators. The batch queuing system routes jobs to hosts
      with appropriate CPU architecture and memory based on the
      user request.
      
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      The resource selection in 7.1 is also subject to
      practicability constraints, such as running compute-intensive







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 117


      jobs on fast processors and running data-intensive jobs on
      machines with fast connections to the storage. Cost
      (exception in the form of service units on supercomputers) is
      not normally an issue because the resources have already been
      paid for and reserved. Individual jobs do not normally have
      large data requirements, but the final data storage
      requirements can be modest to large (100GB-1TB) which
      typically drives the archival storage system selection.
  
  
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
  
      As designed, the compute resources can be dynamic while the
      storage system needs to be static.
    
  
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable 
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      This is an academic endeavor and does not involve proprietary
      data.  Normal Unix security measures protect the data,
      although as the use case expands to include Grid resources,
      many of these protections will have to be relaxed. No
      executable code or hardware security is required.
      
  
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos 
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
  
      ssh
      
  
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentication is the primary need. The others are not
      normally required.
  
  
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify 
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment, 
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      Single API, simple deployment, integration with commodity
      technologies (such as SSH and standard Unix security) are all
      desirable.
  
  
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 118


    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Horizontal scaling of compute resources (more nodes),
      vertical scaling of data (larger single storage), horizontal
      scaling of nodes with fast data access, and vertical scaling
      of networks (fast, scalable communication between a master
      node and remote clusters)
    
  
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      Depending on the particular algorithm used, specific
      instances of this use case will experience varying amounts of
      performance enhancement relative to single processor jobs,
      depending on the communication requirements of the job and
      the heterogeneity of the compute resources available.
      Further, post processing is data intensive and will require
      fast, large memory CPUs attached to the storage system.
  
  
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
   
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
   
     We have been considering Globus, using the Commodity kits
     (Java and Python)
  
   
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
   
      We want the following simple calls: Discover resource, submit
      job, move file. Possibly some support for computational
      steering.

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      In a joint project, the institute of chemistry and dynamics
      of the geosphere (ICG2) of the Research Centre Juelich
      together with the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology
      (Hamburg) are using the transport model MOZART to calculate
      the distribution of chemical tracers and other physical
      properties (temperature, pressure) of the troposphere of the
      earth. Because the resulting dataset is very big, (about 1GB)
      it cannot be stored locally but only at one or more central
      servers.  There is a demand to visualize this data to analyse
      it. To do this, the visualization systems must be coupled to
      the data servers by a fast network to get online access to
      the data.  If the central data servers have enough computing
      power, also the post- processing of the data could be done
      there, e.g. to generate graphical primitives (iso-surfaces,
      streamlines) to speed up the process of visualization.
      Because the analysis of the data should be done by a
      distributed team of scientists located in Juelich and in
      Hamburg, also the visualization- systems should be coupled
      and synchronized to allow collaborative visualization
      sessions. It is intended to use a video conference system to
      support the direct communication of participating scientist.
  
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
    ...
    
    
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
      Scientists from Juelich and from Hamburg want to do a
      collaborative analysis of their atmospherical data. At each
      site, visualization systems are used to explore the data.
      The visualization systems will load an initial scene, connect
      to the data- servers and request a portion of the data, e.g.
      a time interval of interest or data for a selection of
      chemical tracers.  The visualization systems also connect to
      an interaction server, which is responsible for the
      synchronization of the visualization. Furthermore a video
      conference system is started.  While the visualization
      session is running, the scientists interact with the data,
      e.g. they rotate and translate the scene, decide to load
      additional data or to use several visualization techniques
      like cutting planes, iso-surfaces, streamlines, trajectories
      and so on.  All changes in the scene are synchronized online
      by the interaction server which guarantees a consistent
      visualization to allow a well coordinated collaborative work







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 122


      session.  It also could happen that an additional scientist
      will enter a running session. In this case the actual scene
      has to be distributed to this new client.
  
  
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      The users (ICG2, Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology) are
      'topical' scientists (chemist, physicists).  
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      - visualization-systems hardware: a broad range of systems
        from high-end (special graphics workstations,
        Virtual-Reality-Systems) to low-end (e.g. laptop) should be
        supported
      - visualization-systems software: as the involved community
        of scientists is very heterogeneous, a wide variety of
        graphics software should be used, e.g. AVS/Express, VTK,
        VR-software.
      - data-servers: need to have big storage capacity. If the
        data-server is also used as a preprocessor, it should be a
        high performance parallel computer.
      - interaction-server: stores information of running
        visualization sessions. No big storage capacity needed
        here.
      - fast network
      
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes, absolutely. Alls parts of the system (several
      visualization facilities, data-servers, interaction server)
      are distributed geographically.
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      3 main tasks are running simultaneously:
      - data-server activities
      - interaction server
      - visualization stations, in a collaborative session one at
        each site
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 123


        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      Visualization systems: AVS/Express, VTK, VR-Software, e.g.
      Vista (WorldToolkit based VR-Software developed at University
      Aachen) The Visit-Library
      (http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/visit) should be used for
      communication.  Own developments (implementation of data- and
      interaction-server) are done in C++.
  
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      ...
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      No.
  
    
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      ...
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [X] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      ...
  
  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 124


  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      The user can select all resources on his own. He can choose
      the servers and visualization systems.
  
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      ...
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      The network load is highly dynamic because it depends on
      user-interaction and the (dynamic) number of visualization
      systems in a collaborative session.
  
    
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      The data which is send over the network is sensitive.  There
      should be access restrictions and authentication.
  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      No.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentication.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 125


  
      An api which provides a reliable certification mechanism to
      authenticate a user who connects to the system.
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Network is very important to scale up the number of possible
      participants of a collaborative visualization session.  Also
      compute and storage resources are critical.
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      Because the visualized data is very large, the necessary
      postprocessing (surface extraction, ...) could be a
      bottleneck.  Furthermore heavy network traffic is
      concentrated at the central severs, especially at the data
      servers. 
  
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      ...
  
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      No details can be given now because the project is in an
      early stage of development.  The API should have the
      following functionality:
      - login mechanism for connecting to data- and
        interaction-server
      - data exchange (send, receive) for the scientific data
      - data exchange to synchronize the collaborative, distributed
        session







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 126


      - naming mechanism to identify objects which are shared
        between several visualization systems

    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      The European GEMSS Project is concerned with the creation of
      medical Grid service prototypes and their evaluation in a
      secure service-oriented infrastructure for distributed on
      demand/supercomputing.  One of the applications considered in
      GEMSS is medical image reconstruction for single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT), which is an effective
      and robust method for diagnosis of cancer, heart diseases and
      functional pathologies of the human body. 
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
      
      http://www.gemss.de/
    
    
  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 128


    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
    
      1) Service discovery: The registry is inquired by specifying
         service categories (e.g. SPECT) and arbitrary attributes
         (name-value pairs).
    
      2) Service selection: Is done be a GEMSS specific QoS
         negotiation process. Clients and services basically 
         exchange XML descriptors which then might lead to a QoS 
         contract and further on to a resource reservation.
      
      3) Upload of 2D projection data.
    
      4) Upload of reconstruction meta-data (region of interest,
         accuracy, etc.).
    
      5) Start reconstruction.
    
      6) Querying status information (optional).
    
      7) Download of results.
    
      If the user is not satisfied with the results, he may
      initiate another reconstruction with different parameters
      (meta-data) by starting with step 4.
    
    
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      - Science: Application developers using the middleware to
        test and develop codes on different platforms and
        conditions.
      
      - Industry: Medical staff using a graphical client for on
        demand "real-time" image reconstruction.
    
  
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 129


      - Compute Resources: Parallel computers (clusters) on the
        service-side Any Java enabled platform on the client-side
        
      - Advance reservation and scheduling system (e.g. COSY, Maui)
        on service hosts.
        
      - Web/Grid Service hosting environment
    
      - Security infrastructure (PKI infrastructure for x509v3
        certificate handling)  
    
      - Visualization Software (e.g. Spect Client developed by
        Univ. Vienna)
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes, the the current GEMSS testbed comprises two PC clusters
      located at NEC St. Augustin and ISS Vienna, and various
      distributed client installations.
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      One client negotiates with n services, the particular
      reconstruction is a one-to-one relationship between client
      and service. Several clients can execute the same use case in
      parallel on the Grid.
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availability;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      The GEMSS middleware will be distributed under LGPL licence.
    
      There are various applications (mostly parallel MPI codes in
      C and Fortran) which are open and closed source and run under
      different licenses. In general no changes are required to
      integrate the applications with the GEMSS infrastructure.
      
      GEMSS makes use of diverse open-source 3rd party tools and
      libraries (only stable releases) e.g. Apache ant, tomcat,
      axis which are not modified.
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      We use x509v3 certificates, a CA located at NEC and
      registration authorities (RA) at the individual institutions.
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 130


      Registries in GEMSS provide a common Web service interface to
      be independent from the actual implementation (e.g. UDDI).
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      The SPECT application uses CT scanners to acquire 2D
      projection input data. The medical instruments are not
      directly utilized by the Grid infrastructure.
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [X] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
    
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      The Grid applications are exposed as Web/Grid services which
      implement application, QoS negotiation, and recovery
      interfaces. The services can be deployed into Java Web
      service hosting environments.
    
      Client application make use of an API to contact the registry
      services, specify the QoS descriptors, negotiate with the
      services, and execute the application workflow.
  
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      Resource selection can be done at different levels. Services
      can be selected directly (by endpoint), be found in a
      registry, and/or be negotiated based on several constraints.
      Resource selection, negotiation strategy, etc. can be
      delegated to a component provided by the GEMSS client API or
      can be individually implemented by the client application
      developer.  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 131


    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      As the applications are pre-installed on the computing
      resources the user is not aware of the hosting OS. The GEMSS
      service environment incorporates performance and pricing
      models as well as an interface to the resource scheduling and
      reservation system. During the negotiation process clients
      specify the resource requirements in means of begin/end time
      and price. 
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      Resource requirements and offers are negotiated dynamically,
      then fix for the execution.
    
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      Transmission of medical data is very sensitive and advanced
      security a major success criteria within GEMSS. We require
      end-to-end security which does not allow job delegation and
      remote data storing.
  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      Message layer: Own implementation of WS security  (signing +
      encryption).  Transport layer: SSL connection.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      All of them (anonymisation of medical data is often only
      possible to a certain degree).
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      - Integration with commodity technologies (e.g. GSI).
      - Simple deployment, integration, configuration (is currently
        rather complex).







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 132


      - A simple API to select what security mechanisms should be
        used.
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Data is shipped via encrypted SOAP messages, the size is
      depending on the application (1 - 10 MBs for SPECT data).
      Patient data must be stored remotely (exept the current
      session data) for other purposes than processing. This
      requires high network capacity. 
    
      The client requests which are made during a QoS negotiation
      process result in temporary resource reservations. If many
      clients request one resource within short time, the system
      could be blocked by too many temporary reservations.
    
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      The application performance models is based on historical
      data and meta-data descriptions (input data description,
      number of iteration, number of nodes). We require dependable
      performance estimates (which is difficult for some
      applications) as the reservation system relies on them.
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      - GEMSS is Web service based, we use: WSDL, SOAP
        (attachments), WS-Security 
      - We have experimental results with the OGSI (lite)
        container.
      - For Scheduling and advance reservation the COSY resource
        scheduling system and MAUI scheduler and resource
        reservation system are used.
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 133


    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      We would need support for resource reservation and QoS
      negotiation.

      The RealityGrid project is about enabling the use of high-end
      scientific codes on a computational grid.  The project
      involves a wide range of application codes spanning a large
      number of areas of physics. Most of the applications are
      tightly-coupled parallel simulations written in MPI or
      OpenMP. 
  
      The  use case common to all applications is the
      "computational steering" of the code. However "computational
      steering" is a broad term and incorporates many ideas.
     
      At the simplest level, computational steering involves the
      ability to monitor the evolution of the system under study,
      and to manipulate parameters that affect the system's
      behaviour.
  
      The usefulness of computational steering is enhanced by the
      ability to take a checkpoint of the simulation, spawn a new
      simulation (possibly on a different number of processors on a
      different computational resource) from an existing
      checkpoint, and sometimes to rewind a running simulation to
      the state defined in a previous checkpoint.
  
      The ability to visualize aspects of the simulation as it
      evolves is a frequent requirement. In a subset of
      applications, it is more natural to influence the behaviour
      of the simulation by interacting with the visualization. 
     
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g.  "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet
    points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
  
      a. Locate a resource to host a simulation or visualization
         code (currently done manually) b. Launch a simulation or
         visualization on an appropriate resource 
    
      c. Stage input files (including checkpoint files) and
         retrieve or archive output files
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 136


      d. Monitor and steer the simulation as it runs through
         user-friendly GUIs.  We regard pause and resume as 
         steering operations.
    
      e. Dynamically connect/disconnect the steering GUI to/from
         the simulation
    
      f. Visualize one or more aspects (e.g. physical fields) of
         the running simulation - on-line visualization
    
      g. Dynamically connect/disconnect the visualization to/from
         the simulation
    
      h. Take a checkpoint of the status of the simulation i.
         Discover and manage checkpoint files and associated 
         metadata
    
      k. Rewind to a previously taken checkpoint and/or spawn a 
         new simulation from an existing checkpoint (using 
         functionality in i-iii)
    
      l. Co-allocation and advance reservation of resources to 
         host simulation and visualization components
    
      m. Realtime analysis of live streams of data emitted from
         a simulation (this is a generalization of the concurrent
         visualization requirement in (f)).
  
  
  4. Customers: 
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      The customers of this use case are computational scientists,
      with reasonably mature and sophisticated codes, and are
      looking towards the Grid for faster, more efficient and
      effective environments to support in silico scientific
      investigations. 
  
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Hardware: High end computers for both simulations and 
                visualization
      Data:     No specific data requirements
      Software: Application codes instrumented with the 
                RealityGrid Steering library. Currently we 
                also depend on:
                - OGSI/WSRF::Lite as a hosting environment for 







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 137


                  our services
                - globus for file transfer and job submission
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes. Application scientist often use machines on the TeraGrid
      and NGS for simulations as part of the same calculation.
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
        
      Possibly many. They may be homogenous tasks (e.g. several
      replica of a similar simulation) or heteregenous tasks
      (visualization + simulation).
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      Within the RealityGrid project, there are several different
      application codes, which may be open-source, close-sourced or
      third-party codes under license/agreement.
  
      Currently all tools used are publically available.
        
      All applications involve compiling from source code, as we
      modify them to interface with the RealityGrid steering
      library. 
        
      Application codes are written in different languages-
      Fortran, C, C++, and are mostly parallel (MPI,OpenMP). 
        
      Tools and "glue layer" are written primarily in C, C++ and
      Perl.
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      We require digitial certificates. We get these from the UK
      e-Science CA. Some collaborators use the DOE CA.
        
      We use our own registry (implemented using OGSI service group
      constructs) to discover running simulations.  We do not
      currently use registries such as GIIS or UDDI for resource
      discovery - the set of resources which have sufficient
      capability for our purposes, and to which we have access, and
      on which our applications have been deployed is small enough
      that configuration files are adequate. 
      
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 138


        imaging instruments.
        
      A "sister" project which will be launched soon, will 
      involve instrumentation.
    
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      ???
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [X] Occasionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
      The primary reasons for the above:
       - Overhead and "grid" stability reasons: If we had a 
         persistent, stable and usable grid [24/7, 365], we
         would probably migrate to category 1 (i.e. exclusively) 
         for certain applications.
       - Not all problems addressed simulations require
         features which come as value-added on the grid
         
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Simulation codes are written in Fortran90 and C, and
      instrumented using server-side functions of the RealityGrid
      steering library.
  
      Steering clients exist in several flavours:
      * The Qt/C++ GUI for workstations uses the client-side
      * functions of
        the RealityGrid Steering Library.
      * A .NET client suitable for PDAs is tooled against the WSDL
        description of the RealityGrid Steering Grid Service and
        Service Registry.
      * A Java client packaged as a GridSphere Portlet is tooled
        against WSDL.
      * A Java client in the ICENI framework has been built against
        the Steering Library using JNI.
  
      Job launching and migration is treated separately to
      computational steering. We use a graphical "wizard" for these
      purposes; it is written in Qt/C++ and shells out to Globus
      commands (using either commands in the Globus client
      distribution, or available with the Java CoG kit). The wizard
      uses gsoap to communicate with the RealityGrid services
      (registry, checkpoint tree, and steering grid services).

  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      Hardware resources are chosen by the user, As well as which
      grid-service container to use (in turn partly determined by
      resources chosen).  The location of the RealityGrid registry
      is pre-determined.
  
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      Resources used are determined by:
        i.  availability
       ii.  compatibility with requirements, e.g. 
            there are some problem sizes which can run only on 
            the largest possible machines
             
      The decision as to which resource to use is made by the
      application scientist based upon i + ii. Currently there are
      just a handful of resources typically accessible, but at some
      stage (e.g. as the number of choices increase) a resource
      broker may become critical.
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
        
      ReG Applications fall in both categories i.e. dynamic and
      static.
  
      A fundamental premise of computational steering on the grid,
      is that while interacting with a live simulation, if the
      analysis requires further investigation, the infrastructure
      exists to do so (this may involve spawning simulations,
      starting and connecting a visualization, or just simply
      rewinding).  Thus the hardware resources are in general
      dynamic.  The RealityGrid computational steering system
      provides the tools and software infrastructure required to
      use the hardware resources. 
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      As our use-case is exclusively academic, security is a lesser
      priority than simple and efficient utilization.  Theft or
      malicious tampering of data would be an inconvenience (and
      embarrassment) but wouldn't be the end of the world.







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 140


  
      As typically hardware platforms used are externally
      maintained and owned, security concern is that of a
      "responsible user".
        
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      GSI (but this is not built into the application, but into the
      tools layer).
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentication and authorisation on the end resource is
      adequately provided by GSI for the purposes of job launching
      and file transfer.  Security of the middle-tier services used
      for computational steering is currently lacking, due largely
      to the absence of a standardised security model that supports
      delegation in a Web service world.  Message and data
      protection matter, but are not urgent (however some
      industrial collaborators take a different view).
      Anonymisation is a non-requirement for us. Audit trail is
      important as a piece of the larger provenance puzzle.
  
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      All of these are important. Also important are the ease of
      management of private keys for mobile users.
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Compute resources: the more the merrier. Both in terms of the
      number of resources as well as the performance (CPU and
      interconnect) of the resource.
  
      Networks: Some applications can require signficant amounts of
      data being shipped around; larger the physical system, larger
      will be the requirement. Also, if real-time vizualization is
      used, the network capacity should scale while the reliabilty
      must remain high
  
      Our approach for computational steering introduces an
      overhead that can diminish scalability due to the implied
      synchronisation of the parallel simulation code and
      serialisation of output data streams through a single
      processor. However, the impact on scalability is acceptably
      small in most cases of interest to us.







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 141


  
      Scalability of visualization software and hardware as the
      size of the dataset increases is important - we need
      visualizations that can keep up with the simulation.
  
      Arguably our most important scalability concern relates to
      the human effort involved in porting and deploying
      applications (and the middleware stacks they depend on) to an
      increasing variety of Grid resources.
  
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
    Performance of 
    i. High-end computational/visualization resources is critical. 
   ii. Data transfer rates between distributed resources
  
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      Currently using: gsissh, globus-url-copy, globus-job-run,
      GSI, WSDL, Grid Services (OGSI::Lite), SOAP, XML, GridSphere,
      Access Grid, VizServer, Chromium, gsoap.
  
      Currently considering WS-RF, WS-Notification, WS-Security,
      SRB, JSDL, UNICORE, Sakai.
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
  
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      When talking about APIs, it maybe helpful to differentiate
      between application level API and tool level API.
  
      In developing tools for job management and data transfer, we
      would welcome simple APIs that provide:
      - the ability to define and launch a job on a Grid resource
      - copy a file from one remote machine to another
      - sufficient abstraction to future proof our codes from
        changes in fashion.
  
      We would also welcome convergence on a standard API for
      instrumenting a code for computational steering and on-line
      visualization. This would increase the motivation for
      computational scientists to adopt computational steering
      techniques.

        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      The aim of GRID superscalar is to reduce the development
      complexity of Grid applications to the minimum, in such a way
      that writing an application for a computational Grid may be
      as easy as writing a sequential application. Our assumption
      is that Grid applications would be in a lot of cases composed
      of tasks, in most cases repetitives. The granularity of those







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 144


      tasks will be as simulations or programs, and the data
      objects will be files. GRID superscalar provides an
      underlying run-time that is able exploit the parallelism
      existent at the task level, select the machine to send each
      task, send and receive the required files, etc.
    
      To adapt a user application to use the GRID superscalar only
      some slight modifications have to be performed in the code,
      mainly, the programmer selects those functions or programs of
      the application that should be executed in the grid by
      writing its interface in an IDL file. Any sequential code may
      benefit from the GRID superscalar.
  
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
    
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g. "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
    
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please  provide separate descriptions for each component,
    bullet points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
    
      We suppose that a customer wants to gridify its sequential
      code and execute it into a grid. Moreover, we extract all
      possible  parallelism between these tasks. These tasks are
      tipically simulators, that need input files (configuration
      files, trace files, data files, ...) to perform its
      computation. So, the main functionalities needed are:
  
      - Task submission: Allow a remote invocation of a executable
        file.  This file can receive some parameters as inputs, and
        some files, that must be transfered to the machine (the
        worker) with the executable file.
      - State notification: We need notifications in order to know
        when the transfer of files to the worker machine ends, when
        a task is waiting into a queue, when is active, and when it
        has finished.
      - Results collection: At some stages during the execution of
        the user's main program developed with GRID superscalar,
        the runtime needs to transfer some files in order to see if
        the task has executed correctly, and to finally retrieve
        results of the execution. The transfer will be sometimes
        synchronous when we are retrieving a file that is
        immediately needed in the master, and others will be
        asynchronous when the file needs to be transferred when a
        job ends.

  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      A user has developed or is developing an algorithm (more or
      less complicated) and he does this step without thinking in
      parallelism or the grid (in a sequential programming way).
      Then, this user thinks in a way of executing its code in a
      grid, or to extract parallelism from its algorithm. Here GRID
      superscalar can help him.
    
  
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      - Computers or clusters forming a grid to execute jobs.
      - Globus Toolkit 2.4 in order to run jobs (this could be
        changed).
      - gsiftp service in all the different machines in order to
        transfer files involved in the computation (this could be
        changed).
  
  
    
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      They could be.
  
    
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      Minimum one (master and worker running on the same machine)
      and maximum unlimited. In every machine more than one worker
      can be defined in the configuration files (all workers the
      user considers he needs).
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      GRID superscalar library is distributed upon request (without
      source files). We are using GT2.4 for running jobs, gsiftp







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 146


      for transferring files, and we are introducing the Condor
      ClassAds library for specifying restrictions.
    
      User code can be written in C/C++ or Perl. We generate some
      stubs in both parts (master and worker), that must be
      compiled with the main code of the application in order to be
      run.
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      Certificate Autority to sign Globus certificates.
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      No.
  
    
    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [X] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
   
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      As explained above, user can write its code in C/C++ or Perl.
      So, user's environment is a unix shell where he can edit,
      compile, and launch its code. The tool used is GT2.4.
  
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      User tells the runtime what resources it can use, but the
      runtime chooses the best appropriate resource.
    
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 147


    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      The runtime estimates how many time a task needs in order to
      be executed in a machine (this is time of transferring input
      files plus time for executing the task there). The time of
      transferring input files can be avoided
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      Dynamic. If files are already in the machine, we are not
      going to transfer them, so the transfer time is not
      considered.
    
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      Security is determined by Globus (GSI).
  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      GSI.
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Authentication, authorisation, data protection.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      Integration with commodity technologies.
    
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      The application tries to scale using all different available







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 148


      computing resources.
  
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      Since performance improvement is pursued, degradation due to
      the underlying grid middleware will affect (i.e. with GT2.4
      we have 30 seconds penalty per task).
  
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      GT2.4.
  
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      job_submit (job_description, machine_where_to_run)
      job_state  (job_id)
      job_cancel (job_id)
      
      copy_remote_file   (source, dest)
      erase_remote_files (file1, file2, ..., machine)
  
      wait_for_notifications ()
  
      /* to know more information about
      the ending of the remote execution. The objective of this
      call is to obtain an error code from the remote application
      itself, not just the grid middleware error code */
      get_job_error_code (job_id)

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
    
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g.  100 words).
  
      At the Institute of Petroleum and Organic Geochemistry
      (ICG-4) of the Research Centre Juelich two parallel codes
      (TRACE and PARTRACE) for the simulation of solute transport
      in heterogeneous soil-aquifer systems (e.g. pollutants in
      ground water) have been developed and are subject to
      continuous enhancements. The codes TRACE (ground water flow)
      and PARTRACE (solute transport) can run independently or as a
      coupled MPI-application. The progress of the running
      simulation can be monitored by ParView, an AVS/Express based
      application that allows an online-visualization of the
      coupled simulation. Among the steering capabilities of
      ParView are the ability to insert solutants into running
      simulations and the ability to select 3D-points in the
      simulated area for which more detailed data analysis and
      recording is required (so called break-through curves - BTC).
      ParView uses VISIT, a library for online visualization and
      computation steering for its connection to TRACE and
      PARTRACE.
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?
  
      http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/visit
      (--> 'Projects using VISIT' --> ParView)
  
    







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 151


  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ----------------------------------------------------------  
  
      The parallel simulations TRACE (A) and PARTRACE (B) are
      submitted as a single batch-job to the batch-system of an
      HPC-system.  Occasionally, a visualization/steering
      application (C) is attached to (A) and (B) with separate
      connections.  (A) and (B) send data (large arrays and small
      parameter sets) to (C) and upon request receive steering
      parameters back from (C).  Eventually, (C) detaches from (A)
      and (B).
     
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
      The users (ICG-4) are 'topical' scientists (chemist,
      physicists) that use TRACE/PARTRACE to treat their scientific
      problems, like calculating transport properties of the ground
      or compare their models and simulations with real-life
      experiments. The simulations are mostly performed on the IBM
      supercomputer in Juelich. They use the visualization/steering
      capabilities mainly to save computer (and their own) time by
      stopping simulations that go wrong and by adjusting the BTCs
      during the simulation according to intermediate results.
    
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      - parallel computer,     
      - local computer with visualization capabilities (from Laptop
        to Cave)
      - sufficient network bandwidth
    
  
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      most of the time no, since supercomputer and user are located
      on the campus of the Research Centre Juelich, but
      occasionally yes, when a researcher is visiting remote
      collaboration partners or conferences.
  
      In metacomputing experiments that are conducted within the
      project VIOLA, TRACE and PARTRACE are running on two or more
      parallel computers which are geographically distributed. In
      that case, the visualization is also running at a different
      location.
  
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      typically a single parallel computer, on which TRACE and/or
      PARTRACE is running, plus the users visualization-device.
  







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 152


      In metacomputing experiments (e.g. in the VIOLA project), the
      simulations may be distributed over two or more parallel
      computers.
  
    
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      - TRACE (Fortran 90), PARTRACE (C++) are own developments of
        ICG-4 and undergo frequent enhancements
      - VISIT (C) and ParView (AVS/Express) are being developed by
        ZAM
      - no proprietary software except Fortran and C/C++ compilers
        and AVS/Express are needed
  
    
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      A registry is required that allows the components of the
      system to find each other. With VISIT, the
      visualization/steering application registers its service
      (being able to steer a specific application) and the
      simulation queries the registry for possible steerers.
  
    
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      no.
  
    
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      Section 3. lists the minimal functionally required to realize
      the above. 
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [ ] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [X] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.

  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Simulations coded in FORTRAN90 and C++, running on
      UNIX/AIX-systems under control of a batch-system
      Visualization coded in AVS/Express, running on Linux or
      Windows-systems
  
    
  7. How the resources are selected:
  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  
  
      The user selects all resources:
      - the HPC-system by submitting the simulation to a particular
        batch-system (which chooses when and on which CPUs to run
        the job)
      - the visualization-system, which is typically his
        workstation
    
    
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      depending on the batch-system, typically by specifying number
      of CPUs and maximum runtime
    
    
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      static during a single run (simulation) visualization can be
      dynamic, attachment to a simulation from different systems
      with different capabilities (performance, network bandwidth)
  
    
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      The simulation establishes a network connection to an
      external application (the visualization/steering application)
      and is controlled by it. Therefore the steerer needs to
      authenticate properly. Besides that, there are no special
      security considerations.







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 154


  
    
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
    
      UNICORE
    
    
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      authentication and authorisation of the steerer.
  
    
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify
        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies.  
  
      a simple API for the simulation and the
      visualization/steering application that is mostly independent
      of the underlying Grid system (like specifying a certificate
      or password to use/accept)
  
    
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Large parallel simulations may produce huge amounts of data.
      Therefore the system must scale with respect to:
      - number of CPUs/tasks of the simulation
      - volume of data to be transferred to visualization
      - volume of data to be visualised
  
    
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      for visualization and steering, latency and data throughput
      of the system may be an issue. Aspects that influence that,
      are:
      - simulation performance: interaction with the visualization
        only takes place at certain times, typically once per
        simulation time-step. To get some interactivity, such a
        time-step should not take to long
      - network bandwidth for large bulk transfers of simulation
        data may be required
      - visualization capability 
  
      In total, the simulation uses an expensive resource







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 155


      (HPC-time) and should be slowed down as little as possible by
      the interaction with the visualization/steering application.
  
    
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      We have build a version of VISIT, which uses UNICORE to
      access the parallel computer through a firewall and are
      currently working on an integration with the new Web-Services
      based UNICORE being developed in the UniGrids project.
    
    
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  --------------------------------------------  
    
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.
  
      Here an example of the simulation (client) API of VISIT:
   
      /* attach to a visualization, using a service-name and a
       * password */
      vcd = visit_connect_seap (servicename, password, timeout);
  
      /* send some data */
      visit_send (vcd, tag, timestanp, data, datatype, dimensions);
  
      /* receive some data */
      visit_recv (vcd, tag, &timestamp, data, &datatype,
                  &dimensions);
    
      /* detach from visualization */
      visit_disconnect(vcd);
  
      For higher-level functions that provide more options and
      parameters (e.g. complex data-structures to be exchanged,
      distributed data-arrays in a parallel application) a static
      API could end up in a large number of functions with complex
      parameter-lists. An alternative is a simple
      specification-language for the data to be exchanged and a
      code-generator that generate wrapper-functions with an
      application-specific API. Here is an example code:
  
      /* init connection for application 'trace' */
      lvisit_trace_init(); 
    
      while (SimTime) {
    
        /* test connection, open a new one if necessary  */
        lvisit_trace_check_connection();
        
        /* receive parameters from visualization in application







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 156


         * structure 'parm' */
        lvisit_trace_parm_recv(&parm)
    
        /* send 3d vector data 'velo' (which is distributed) to
         * visualization */
        lvisit_trace_velo_send(&velo,nx,ny,nz,3); }
    
      /* close the connection */
      lvisit_trace_close()
    
      Here an excerpt of the corresponding definition in the
      specification-language:
      ...
      dataset velo:
        datatype     = double
        direction    = sim -> vis
        dimension    = 3 
        veclen       = 3
        compression  = wavelet
        distribution = domain
      ...

  2. Introduction:
  ----------------
   
    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case    .
        Background to the project is another alternative.  
        (E.g. 100 words).
  
      This project lies within the NAREGI (National Research Grid
      Initiative) framework. Our goal is to provide a Grid Service
      Framework for Massive Data Visualization of various
      simulations' types, including coupled simulations.
  
      Most simulations in any scientific fields can never
      accomplish their purpose without visualization (in concurrent
      or in post-processing), which enables researchers to observe
      and analyze their unrecognizable numerical results.
    
      This project ambitions the realization of an API for the grid
      services infrastructure. This API serves to connect two
      remote systems client and server by the grid medium and
      offers the client a set of tools to perform visualization of
      large-scale simulations. The visualization is based on images
      transferred from the server to the client and visualization
      controls sent by the client to the server.
    
      Additional features such as Tracking/Steering is also in the
      possible range of inclusion.
  
  
  
    2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?

  3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
  ---------------------------------------------------------- 
   
    Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.
    E.g.  "move a file from A to B," "start a job."
   
    Please include figures if possible.
  
    If your use case requires multiple components of functionality,
    please provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet
    points of 50 words per functionality are acceptable.
     
      To help understand the following points a small glossary is
      added:







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 159


    
      Server: A visualization capable solver, data-mining program,
              third party application, etc. running on a grid 
              resource.
      Service provider: A grid service or any program that 
              interface the client and server. The provider can 
              run on a different resource as both server and 
              client, it can also be part of the server 
              application.
      Client: The visualization application running on the user's
              local computer.
  
      The functionalities can be applied to one or more of the
      following target categories: {common, post-processing,
      concurrent, database}.
  
      - Locate a resource to host a simulation (with visualization
        capability).  This should be done automatically based on
        the nature of the simulation the user is preparing.
        [common]
      - Launch the simulation server, including visualization
        service, on the resource allocated. [common]
      - Send visualization control commands and receive a sequence
        of images back (streaming capability). [common]
      - Replay a sequence of image (eventually video) stored on a
        remote resource. No simulation is running, only
        post-processing output is read. [post-processing, database]
      - Steer the simulation/application (pause, stop, resume,
        etc).  [concurent]
      - Plug-in or Plug-out from a running simulation without
        affecting it.  [concurent]
      - Real-time tracking of simulation parameters. [concurent]
      - Database access to retrieve a stored result. [database]
      - File transfer. [common]
  
   
  4. Customers:
  -------------
  
    Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In
    particular, where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and
    for whom it occurs.  E.g. max 40 words
  
      We can categorize different customer types:
      - Post-Processing: They want to visualize and manipulate
        massive amount of data on site to avoid transfer between
        systems.
      - Concurrent: They want to visualize an on going massive data
        computation. No need for data output, the simulation
        results is displayed on the fly.
      - Repository Access: They want to access images, videos, or
        processed simulation results in a repository (database,
        file system, etc.)
      - Application Service: Some applications like PyMol can be
        made available on high performance systems to perform
        visualization jobs remotely.







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 160


  
      In each case, they are looking toward the Grid for its
      potential without the hassle of knowing how to operate of the
      Grid.
   
   
  5. Involved Resources:
  ----------------------
  
    5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
        software might be involved.
  
      Hardware: High-end computers for simulations and 
                visualization The hardware does not need High-end 
                rendering capability like a SGI machine. Any HPC 
                system is acceptable. Client can run on any piece 
                of hardware.
      Data:     No specific data requirements
      Software: Now Unicore and/or Globus as middleware. Later, 
                any OGSA or WSRF implementation will do.
  
   
    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?
      
      Yes. The resources can span from a local machine to a fully
      earth's spread system.
  
   
    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
        many remote tasks are executing at the same time?
  
      From 1 to N, where N is the maximum capacity the grid can
      offer.  In the case of coupled simulations the interactions
      between the different tasks can be quite complex.
  
   
    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
        available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort of
        third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is
        their availablility;  do you regularly work from source
        code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages are
        your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.
        Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.
  
      All code produced within the project will be open-sourced at
      the finalization of the project. All third party code used
      must have similar license agreements.
  
      Languages: FORTRAN & C for the visualization side. Java for
      the client side.
  
   
    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
        authorities, or registries.
  
      A registry is required that allows the components of the







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 161


      system to find each other. We would like to use registries
      such as GIIS or UDDI for resource discovery, but own registry
      usage is also possible. This will depend on the deployment
      environment.
  
   
    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute or
        data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical
        imaging instruments.
  
      In general case no, but that may depend on the application
      developed.
  
   
    5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
        described in the use case section where possible.
  
      N/A
  
  
    5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like
        systems?
  
        [X] Exclusively
        [ ] Often (say 50-50)
        [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
        [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.
  
  
      The goal of this project is to offer the Grid capability to
      other applications or projects. We are therefore completely
      committed to the Grid or Grid-like systems.
  
  
   
  6. Environment:
  ---------------
  
    Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
    for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the
    user environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).
  
      Simulation servers are generally written in FORTRAN or C.
      The visualization library has bindings in FORTRAN and C.
      This code runs, for example, on OSs like Super-UX, AIX, or
      *NIX systems.
  
      The Grid Service wrappers can be written in Java, C/C++
      depending on the application wrapped. Most likely target will
      be the same as the simulation/visualization servers. 
  
      To avoid the hassle of cross-platform compatibility the
      client sides are targeted to be all Java based.
  
   
  7. How the resources are selected:







  2005-04-22 16:38       === GGF SAGA-RG - Use Cases ===        Page 162


  ----------------------------------
  
    7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent
        in the application, and which are chosen by system
        administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying
        the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks? 
  
      The resources are decided by the problem the user wants to
      solve.  The application will request the registry. The user
      may have to choose between different available resources if
      they are available.
   
   
    7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
        by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
        of information, size of datasets?
  
      OS, Architecture, Memory, disk space, CPU power, software
      availability (if the service is pre-installed).
   
   
    7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?
      
      For a given request the resource is in general static, but
      this also depends on how the server side is setup.
   
  
   
  8. Security Considerations:
  ---------------------------
  
    8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable
        code, data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are
        security measures used to determine access, if any?
  
      The information transmitted on the grid by each peer is on
      most cases highly sensitive. The middleware (communication
      layer) must ensure tight security.
  
   
    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos
        5, Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
   
      For the moment we exclusively relay on the UNICORE or Globus
      kits.
   
   
    8.3 What are your security needs: authentication,
        authorisation, message protection, data protection,
        anonymisation, audit trail, or others?
  
      Setup phase: authentication, authorization Runtime: message
      protection
  
   
    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify

        your security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment,
        integration with commodity technologies. 
  
      Middleware should take care of the security issues. The
      application should just specify that high security connection
      is necessary.
  
   
   
  9. Scalability:
  ---------------
  
    What are the things which are important to scalability and to
    what scale - compute resources, data, networks ?
  
      Large-scale simulations are generally limited by the
      computation resource available. The scaling would take place
      on the number of CPU allocated. Another scalable factor would
      be the image size to control the data size.
  
  
   
  10. Performance Considerations:
  -------------------------------
  
    Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use
    case.
  
      The computational resource is the most critical issue. In
      visualization we must expect at least 1 frame/second for
      rendering (without the simulation computation time, if any)
  
      The second important matter is the network latency, the
      faster the response the better. Network capacity is dependent
      on the resolution of the image the user wants, not on the
      size of the problem to simulate.
  
  
   
  11. Grid Technologies currently used:
  -------------------------------------
  
    If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which
    grid technologies are you using or considering?
  
      Using: WSRF. XML, Unicore, Globus.
  
      Future: SAOP, GridFTP, MPICH-G
  
   
   
  12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?
  -------------------------------------------- 
   
    Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would
    like in an API which would support your scenario.

      We are currently defining a general visualization framework
      API.  From the client point of view the following code can be
      considered as an example:
  
      Post-Processing Service:
      ************************
      // Generate an instance of Post visualization service.
      VisualizationService pvs = VisServiceFactory.newInstance 
                                 (POST_PROCESSING_SERVICE, ...);
    
      // Set data file which contents is visualized
      pvs.setDataFile ("gsiftp://localhost:2811/tmp/file1");
    
      // Setting parameter
      pvs.setCamera (...);
      pvs.setLight  (...);
     
      // Generate a visualized image
      byte[] imageData = pvs.getImage();
    
    
      Concurrent Service:
      *******************
      // Generate an instance of Concurrent service.
      VisualizationService cvs = VisServiceFactory.newInstance
                                 (CONCURRENT_SERVICE, ...);
     
      // Setting initial parameter
      cvs.setCamera          (...);
      cvs.setLight           (...);
      cvs.setBackgroundColor (...);
      cvs.setImageSize       (...);
    
      // Get the visulization streeming. Images or image sections 
      // are streamed on an input stream.
      InputStream vizInput = cvs.getInputStream ();
    
      // Visualize
      while (...)
      {
          // Process the content of the stream.
          ...
    
          // Set new parameters.
          ...
      }
    
    
      In these examples we consider that authentication, job
      launching, etc is done prior to get a visualization service.
