  ...
  
  
3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:
----------------------------------------------------------  
  
  Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.  E.g. "move
  a file from A to B," "start a job."
  
  Please include figures if possible.

  If your use case requires multiple components of functionality, please  
  provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet points of 50
  words per functionality are acceptable.
  
  ...
  

  
4. Customers:
-------------

  Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In particular,
  where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and for whom it occurs.  
  E.g. max 40 words

  ...
  

  
5. Involved Resources:
----------------------

  5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,
      software might be involved.

  ...

  
  5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?

  ...

  
  5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how
      many remote tasks are executing at the same time?

  ...

  
  5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is
      available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort 
      of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is 
      their availablility;  do you regularly work from source 
      code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages 
      are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g. 
      Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.

  ...

  
  5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate
      authorities, or registries.

  ...

  
  5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute 
      or data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical 
      imaging instruments.

  ...

  
  5.7 Please link all the above back to the functionalities
      described in the use case section where possible.

  ...


  5.8 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like 
      systems?

      [ ] Exclusively
      [ ] Often (say 50-50)
      [ ] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone
      [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.



  
6. Environment:
---------------

  Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,
  for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the user
  environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).

  ...


  
7. How the resources are selected:
----------------------------------

  7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent 
      in the application, and which are chosen by system
      administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying 
      the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?  

  ...
  
  
  7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,
      by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability
      of information, size of datasets?

  ...
  
  
  7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?

  ...
  

  
8. Security Considerations:
---------------------------

  8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable code, 
      data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are security 
      measures used to determine access, if any?

  ...

  
  8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos 5,
      Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?
  
  ...
  
  
  8.3 What are your security needs: authentication, authorisation,
      message protection, data protection, anonymisation, audit 
      trail, or others?

  ...

  
  8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify your
      security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment, integration
      with commodity technologies.  

  ...
