The CMM-WG will have two half-day sessions in GGF9, which will
act as a mini face-to-face meeting. This will give people time 
to think, write text, etc. overnight.

The agenda (still preliminary) is:

Time: 12:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.  Central Time

(a) Early discussion (attendance list, note taker assignment, etc.)

(b) Introduction and updates (for people not attending teleconferences)
- What is CMM (Ellen) - 15 minutes
- Where is CMM (Fred) - 10 minutes
  This is an explanation of the CMM position on the OGSA architecture
- Update on WG status (Fred) - 20 minutes
  This will consist mainly of an explanation on the relationship with OASIS WSDM
  (background and current status)
