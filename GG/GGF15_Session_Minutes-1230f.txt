Susan speaks:  No Q's

Abdeslem speaks: 

- Steven Davey asks about ResolveEPR and WSNaming work. A: says that
  it has a different semantics - they are dealing with services which
  may move.

Dieter speaks:

- Malcolm Atkinson asks is this spam?  A: it is spamming to the right people.

- Malcolm Atkinson: We could use work-flows for this. A: This is a process
  oriented rather than data oriented view.

- Malcolm Atkinson - slide 12 - how can you do all in a transaction as the
  consumer may vanish. A: Only the hops are atomic.

- Malcolm suggest that WSAgreement may be suitable for matching
  policies. Abdeslem suggests that it is more in line with
  WSN. Malcolm also points out that handling complex vocabularies can
  be very time-consuming. This needs following up. There is a session
  at 08:00 on Thursday morning.

- Malcolm - INFOD is becoming all of distributed computing. It seems
  to be over-kill for DAIS 3rd part delivery.

- Malcolm - we need elephant burgers so that the individual bits can
  be accepted. Abdeslem agrees that the spec should be broken up
  further.

- Karen asks: how does this differ from WSN and WS-Eventing. A: WSN
  has evolved. WSN has topics - but INFOD has much more.
