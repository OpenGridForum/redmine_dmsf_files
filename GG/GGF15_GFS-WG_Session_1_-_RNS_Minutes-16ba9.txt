Meeting
-------
1. RNS update

o Resource Namespace Service
 - A multi-faceted approach for addressing the needs of access to
   resources within a distributed network or grid
 - Facilitates a uniform and universal namespace where:
  - Names resolve to ultimate target addresses
  - Names are hierarchically managed
  - Names may be used in human interface applications and browsable
 - Utilizes document style messaging
 - Intended to facilitate namespace services for a wide variety of
   Grid services
  - OGSA Basic Profile compliant Web service capable of providing
    namespace services for any addressable entity by registering an
    Endpoint Reference 

o RNS Three-tier Naming Architecture

 human interface names - logical references - endpoint references
 - mapping from human interface names to endpoint references,
   and mapping from human interface names to logical references
 - optional RNS resolver porttype that maps from logical references
   to endpoint references

o operations
 - naming
  create, delete, list, lookup, update
 - implicit
  move, rename, mkdir
 - extensibility
  {delete,insert,update}Property, listProperties

o draft status
 - all file system specific features has been factored out
 - final round of internal review and comments
 - plan to submit to GFD editor in Nov 2005
   - 15day GFSG Comment
   - 60day public comment
 - ownership of RNS travisions to OGSA-naming WG
 - GFS-WG to begin GFS Naming Profile now

o RNS
 - was ready for submission in early Aug
 - OGSA F2F comments
  - reference to virtual directory
  - simplify junctions
 - reference implementation
  - RNS service provider implementation
  - RNS service consumer implemenattions
   - namespace administration graphical user interface
   - command-line (core API library)
  - IBM alphaWorks
  - Globus toolkit

Q: how do you handle secrity, access control
A: access control is needed, but it is not included for now.  We need
   discussion with security folks.

o RNS Recent Revisions
 - New section: binding to RNS
  - virtual directory can now be directly referenced
  - changed "full paths" to "relative paths"
 - Removed "Type" Property
  - namespace entries are now either Virtual directories or Junctions
  - alias and referral is a junction to a virtual directory
 - Revised Referral Message Mechanism
  - removed RNSJunctionFault
    accomodate new binding approach, instead, send back an EPR
    including PathRemainder
 - Junction Revisions
  - rns:Path
  - rns:PathRemainder
 - New Sections
  - Service Binding
  - IteratorContext
    * important, need to be emphasized
  - Absolute Paths
    * spaning multiple context

o telecon next week to finalize the spec

2. GFS profile

o profile

  checksum, checksumType, complete, mutablesource, readonly,
  replicacopy, size, timestamp, version

o need more usecase

C: checksum should be digest
