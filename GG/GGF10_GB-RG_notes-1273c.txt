update: document status
	one doc on ALU intensive GB in pipeline
	5 new proposals
		data cube DC data intensive GB
		data traffic DT comm intensive GB
		GRASP comm intensive grid probes
		sleep-0 proc intensive GB
		rapid fire RF proc intensive GB

charter revisit:
	we propose a set of tasks that assess grid perf at the level of the user apps--specified as a paper-and-pencil benchmark

	not: characterize existing and emerging grid apps

	delivs:
		want: a small set of families of grid benchmarks
		not: a framework that specifies the requirements of constructing
			new data flow graphs to be used as GB's

types of grid benchmarks
	dominated by computation (ALU-intensive) AIGB
		reference implementations
		doc w/ AIGB p-a-p specs (GGF10)
	GGF11: DIGB DC, CICB (DT GRASP) PIGB (RF, sleep-0)
	GGF12: ref impl's
	GGF13: final docs w/ p-a-p specs of all of above

NOTE: This may be too ambitious given the amount of activity we've seen on the mailing list, etc
	
GGF Informational document: ALU Intensive GB's

tried to run ref benchmark: trouble compiling for Fortran on linux
	(RVW: fixed)

Rosa CEPBA?: have implemented all in GridSuperscalar: problem is Size A has 9 nodes; need more nodes

graphs of ED, HC, VP, and MB

VP note: needs to be directed path from any node to report node

MB: challenge to implementers (try to schedule)

diagrams are for smallest size
	VP: +n "iterations" of 3 step chain; work w/in node grows too
	MB: add row & col for each increasing class size

only go to class "C" because NPB class "D" runs for hours on a supercomputer

try to grow graphs to roughly keep communication/computation ratio the same

Andrea Note: there are two extra jobs; 
RVW: when NPB processes are connected they have
different discretizations--different array sizes; need to do reduction & 
interpolation; this is work attached to computational nodes; (e.g. part of the MG);
the "mesh filter" program; not necessary to do it the way the ref impl does it;
the globus version groups pre--proc, proc, and post-proc in same graph node
Andrea NOTE: needs to have an explanation in document

error criterion: output data as data or ASCII; for heterogeneity; had been a problem
with free formatted ASCII output; is not formatted

representation: other plans besides p-a-p specs?  e.g., use UML to spec them?
	role of GGF is to do stds docs; could derive other things; would want
	to see if there is a need in community; formulate useful extensions &
	put on mailing list

are there companies providing benchmarks?  none known; benchmarks usually done
	by groups of people (users)

------------------------------------------------------
switch to Andrea Casotto with proposal for PIGB

test ability to handle jobs (many tiny jobs)
expose & measure overhead of job mgmt system

job: 
	dispatch-able
	stoppable
	recoverable
	accountable
commands that do nothing:
	sleep 0
	echo $N
	/bin/true
	empty shell script
	empty C program
	is there a sleep 0 web-service
Benchmark proposal
	measure time to submit & execute 1000 sleep-0's
	sleep-zero-ps (s0ps)
measurements
	25 CPUS t=29m 0.57 s0ps
	200       25s 40 s0ps
use benchmark to match grid w/ workload
	low s0ps: don't submit lots of small jobs; lump small comp'l units into 1 job
	high s0ps: could submit
examples of high s0ps needs
	VLSI library characterization (10k+ sims, 20 secs ea)
	protein folding
bad benchmark
	simple shell loop with sleep 0
validation of benchmark
	could do echo $N; sum results; check value
future
	when can run 1000000 sleep0's in a reasonable amount of time
	when will we get 1000 s0ps

Q: what about scheduling?
Q: ?; possible scheduling error
	have families of benchmarks
C: very easy to implement

anyone know how to build a web service that does nothing?

-----------------------------------
RVW: another PIGB proposal

AIGB: class X uses NGB class X
AIGB: class X>=A uses A
PIGB: class X uses S
	premature numerical convergence; introduce time-dependent source term
	verification of many nodes (wide ED and MB grophs); verify arith avg of soln of
		all nodes that are connected to report node

suggestions:
	why is VP 3xN?  because of 

RVW: amount of work in PIGB class X is supposed to match work in AIGB class X
