OGSI Process Session March 10, 2004 19:00

Chairman: David Snelling
Note Taker: Steve Teucke

Note: These minutes reflect changes requested on the mailing list
following the meeting.

OGSI 1.0 status and plans:
   - Options on OGSI 1.0:
       - convert to recommendation now, or
       - convert to historical, superseded, or recommendation
         after wsrf plays out

   - Savas: Another option: Write an OGSI 2.0 document that is a profile
            of the other WS capabilities that would solve the same set of
            problems as OGSI 1.0. (Write an OGSI 2.0 specification that
            pre-reqs only WS specifications that are used by WS-I
            BasicProfile.)

   - Stephen Pickles: Should we do an experiences document?
       - Why? 
          - Snelling: It would a useful document to have.
       - Jim Webber: He would be willing to write an OGSI experiences
                    document, so that this can push to standards.
       - Others who would help: Stephen Pickels, one other spoke up
         and will contact Stephen directly.
       - Do not need security for interop for OGSI interop. However,
         the security issue was thought to be interesting.
       - A person from the Globus team was requested to join the project.
         but no one present was interested. A general call to the list
         is expected as well as socialization within the Globus community.

Steve T. can only put in minimal time as co-chair.
   - If anybody wants to replace him, speak up.

OGSI-WG activities
   - Primer is ready to go to the editor
   - Tim Banks: What should we do with the primer in light of WSRF?
                If we want to revise the primer for WSRF, we might
                need to deal with the copyright.
       - Dave Snelling: GGF copyright allows OASIS to run with it.

Savas: Why is re-charter needed for his OGSI 2.0 idea?

Charter says:  "The OGSI working group expects to gather requirements,
evaluate related technologies, and begin discussions of possible solutions
for inclusion in OGSI v2.0. However, the working group does not expect to
expend substantial effort on a v2.0 specification until late 2003, at the
earliest. When the working group decides to begin serious work on v2.0, it
will re-charter the working group with GGF to establish scope and time
lines on that effort."

Close.
