Agenda ok'd.

Hrabri presented the DRMAA 1.0 document introduction slide set (see
attached)

Andreas presented on the issues of language bindings, and discussed the
draft C binding proposed document (preso will be sent soon; the draft C
binding doc is attached).

Andreas also presented on DRMAA implementation, specifically a demonstation
of a DRMAA-enabled DRM system (Grid Engine) running on a single Apple OS X
system and the compiled DRMAA test case (as shown in the proposed spec)
running on the same machine.

Hrabri closed with a general conversation about futures and QA.

Q&A issues:

Error returns have some gaps - for instance, how to report back exit status
from the DRM system.

There was some comments about interaction with other GGF WGs: GAT, GRAAP,
CMM, JSDL. Where is the management of the integration of these
specifications?  Also some discussion around the potential for relationship
of DRMAA to Globus Gram, Unicore.
