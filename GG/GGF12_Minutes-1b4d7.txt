Session 1 - 22/9/04 at 09:00
----------------------------

Chris Kantarjiev speaks first to explain the motivation for INFOD. He
emphasises that it addresses both push and demand driven publication. See
slides.

Susan Malaika presents an overview of the Use Cases. See slides. It was
suggested that classifying the use cases according to their
characteristics would be useful.

The relationship with DAIS was then discussed (while Susan's laptop
recovers). It was generally recognised that there was considerable
uncertainty and that the relationship should be clarified. This would be
done mainly by e-mail. It was agreed that we should collaborate/integrate
as much as possible

Norman Paton observed that pub/sub does not occur much because often
people have passive systems - and therefore use add-hoc mechanisms. We
need to make systems active.  Dieter replied that this was his view of
what INFOD would do.

Dave Pearson suggested that people need education - to think in terms of
pub/sub.
