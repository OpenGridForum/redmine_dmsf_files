                          Notes of GGF12 DRMAA WG session
                               22nd of Sept. 2004

Hrabri Rajic     Introduction/Overview/Scope
                 DRMAA WG History
                 Bindings (C, Java, .Net, Perl)
                 Implementations

Peter Troeger    Demo: Example code walkthrough
                 distributed picture rendering using dpovray/DRMAA

Discussion       * Relationship SAGA RG and DRMAA
                   Hard to say what direction SAGA will go

                 * GGF does not know to what direction DRMAA WG goes
                   DRMAA WG to work on milestones (Stephen Pickles)

Peter Troeger    Objectoriented view on Java- and .Net-Binding and possible
                    impacts on language independent DRMAA specification
                 * Differences of dynamic binding in .Net and Java
                   Discussion about general relevance of factory-alike
                   dynamic bindings
                   --> no need to change anything
                 * Support for partial time stamps .Net and Java
                   --> there is a need for part. time stamps in all lang bindings
                 * Differences with deletion of job templates in .Net and Java
                   --> delete should be a method of the session object
                 * Differences in attribute accesses in .Net and Java
                   (dedicated method for each attribute vs. a generic
                   getter/setter method)
                   --> no need to change anything
