CDDLM #4, Cross WG session, June 8, 2:30 - 4pm
Chair: Dejan Milojicic
Note Taker: Takashi Kojo
The meeting is for discussing relationship to
other groups in/outside GGF. Chairs from CMM, GRAAP and 
WSDM were presented.
The meeting started from the diagram of CDDLM
and other components (GRAAP/WS-A, DRMAA, WSDM/CMM, EMS,
WS-RF/WS-N), questioning if there is anything missing on the
diagram.
About EMS:
Comment: EMS tries to structure up from scratch.
Comment: They are trying to strive for the concept.
D: They seem to jump into design.
F: They are framework for batch job.
   OGSA is aware of CDDLM. Not much discrepancy.
   Provisioning is yet well defined.
Question: Is the CDDLM service MOWS or MUWS?
    It is MUWS. Target of the service is Application or WS.
Comment: Provisioning, Deployment, Installation,...
     Not well defined terms.
Q: What is relationship between WS-Agreement and CDDLM?
Dj: CDDLM supplies XML-Description of deployment to WS-A.
Q: What is the dependence between resources?
Dj: JSDL -> WS-A -> Somebody -> CDDLM
Q: Does CDDLM deal with negotiation?
A: CDDLM is limited to deploying on the resources
  allocated somewhere else.
H: About WSDM: one discussion is
	Resource oriented v.s. Agent oriented
   What is Agent? It is with Management Agent so that
   managed resource exposes just i/f
Comment: DRMAA is all but submission. More on static
   environment. 
Q: Is it pre-Agreement?
Comment: What are they doing in Workflow-RG?
	Their focus is on ordering or the services.

Q: How about deploying connectivity?
A: In long term.
Q: What about deploying license?
Q: Is it equivalent to allocate resource?
About Demo:
Comment: preferrable base tachnology is WS-RF/N.
Comment: WSDM is going to have interop demo with HP, IBM
  and other (5 implimentations).
Comment: DRMAA has two implementations.
Comment: EMS and WS-A have just document.
About Next Step:
   XML-CDL will be finalized.
   Detail discussion on Basic Services and Component Model.
   Workshop and Demo.
Q: What drives the process?
A: Interrop demo of simple scinarios
Comment: Sun is interested in the introp demo.
Dj: Where CDDLM should end up?
    Contributing to grid research?
    Do like WS-Deployemnt, donate to OASIS?
