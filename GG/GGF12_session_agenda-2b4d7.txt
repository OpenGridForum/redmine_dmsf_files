The CMM-WG will have one session in GGF12, which will be a
cross-WG session among all groups interested in
manageability in OGSA. Participation is expected from the
OGSA-WG, WSDM TC, DMTF (specially the UCWG), and any
other GGF WGs interested in manageability.

It is expected that this session will be a free discussion on
the state of manageability in OGSA, progress since GGF11, how
the standards fit together, and where work needs to be done. 
In case there are specific topics for discussion, please send
them to Fred Maciel.

Date and time: September 22, 5:30 - 7:00 PM
Room: D008
Agenda (preliminary): free discussion on OGSA manageability
Leader: Fred Maciel
