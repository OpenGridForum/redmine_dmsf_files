DAIS session at GGF16, Wedndesday 15 February 2006, 13:30 - 15:00 
=================================================================

Note Taker: Amy Krause

Dave Pearson's (DP) presentation

A reasonable number of people present have read the specs

Malcolm Atkinson (MA): List of issues that were put aside for later
                       consideration?

Norman Paton (NP): on gridforge

Norman's presentation

BOF for RDF data access

MA: In addition to writing a realisation of the WS-DAI spec somebody
    may specialise DAIX or DAIR specs or add more functionalities

Dieter Gawlick (DG): Has the RDBMS sufficient information to handle
authorization of the derived data sources?  New resources are detached
from the old resource and have to provide authorization DAIS does not
try to handle that

Steve Lynden's presentation

What happened to DAI-O (object databases) ?
Ran out of steam, no interest.

DAIR implementation:
Lots of optional features that have to be decided
Deficiency of the spec? No, allows for more flexibility

problem with substitution grops when generating stubs with Axis

OGSA-DAI Webrowset is used for caching result sets
This causes performance issues which is not surprising.

DAIX implementation:

Diagram comparing performance of OGSA-DAI R7 and DAIR implementation
Direct access, no caching, no factory operation

MA: WS-DAIR will be made available - is it supported? Who provides
support?  Unsupported - only available to interested parties, as a
tech preview

Stephen Davey (SD): Do DAIX and DAIR talk to each other?
No - doesn't make much sense

NP: Could write a client which establishes connections to both types
    of services
MA: There are ways of translating
SD: Are DAIX and DAIR interoperable?
NP: Could use the same code, some small shared bits of code (destroy,
    properties)
SD: Do you expect they should be able to talk to each other?
NP: What are you trying to do?
SD: Might be sending data from DAIR to DAIX in pipelining scenario
NP: Can't get two services to talk to each other at the moment.
    A scenario:
    Open connection to one service
    get results
    open connection to DAIX
    store results
SD: Can you ask DAIR to store results in a DAIX service?
DP: At DBMS level you can use XML access to relational DB
MA: No reason why one service couldn't support both port types
DP: At DBMS level it wouldn't matter because you're passing a string
    Resource properties have to satisfy both types of access

Slide on testing strategy

MA: Sounds like interop test but the services will never communicate
    They are providing equivalent services
NP: Need to clear up the wording
MA: Aim/plan is good 

DB: no interop test for two systems but a set of tests showing that
    they are equivalent

NP: provide a sufficient set of functions

Testing strategy details

MA: Can't test all details
    Have to ensure that modest implementations pass the test
NP: Testing only functionality

Informational document
Suggestion that there is an experiences document

DB: Each impl team can write tests to swap
MA: Form of an interop fest but not the same as the base testing
    Two issues:
    - is the standard useful?
    have an extensive test suite
    cover what 99% of users want to do
    as an example, GridFTP is used a lot but interop fest would show
    up problems for less used functionality

Forms of optional features

SD: Experiences
    Write a draft of planned tests before running and submit to GGF
MA: Discuss on the mailing list
NP: Would liked to have a sign-off by area directors

Dave Pearson: Discussion on Future Activities

DAIS for RDF: BOF tomorrow
Continuous queries

Access to Files: Demand but no people to work on it

[Action] Send email to DAIS mailing list re interest in files realisation
	 Issue for Data Area meeting

MA: Think about a wider area than only DAIS mailing list

Dieter Gawlick on Continuous Queries
Looking for a place to work on this, there's at least one person from
Oracle available to help to push it
MA: other people interested?
IBM are very interested
Proposing a research group over a fixed period, e.g. a year, fixed
deliverables Could be raised as an issue/proposal in the data area
meeting
