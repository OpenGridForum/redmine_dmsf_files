The purpose of this session is to understand and share the current
state of data discovery techniques on the grid in order to produce a
summary     of current data discovery methods and needs.

project</span>,  James D. Myers, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <br>
    <br>
The Scientific Annotation Middleware (SAM) project ( <a href="http://www.scidac.org/SAM/">http://www.scidac.org/SAM/</a>) is
developing a layered set of services for  managing application data,
metadata, pedigree, and annotations on the  web/Grid. This talk will
highlight several aspects of SAM including its:
    <ul>
      <li> uniform view of file-based and database content in terms of a
typed data  resource and associated text/XML key/value pair metadata </li>
      <li> ability to provide a federated view of multiple databases
based on XML  descriptions of the mappings </li>
      <li> ability to dynamically associate new metadata with existing
database/file content </li>
      <li> mechanisms for dynamically configuring internal/external
metadata extractors and metadata/data translators </li>
    </ul>
Examples will be given of how these capabilities are being used in the
Collaboratory for Multiscale Chemical Science (CMCS) to provide
electronic notebook functionality, portal-based data pedigree browsing
capabilities, and lightweight application integration. Related links: <a href="http://collaboratory.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/collab/presentations/papers/sam.cise.mayjun03.final.pdf">http://collaboratory.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/collab/presentations/papers/sam.cise.mayjun03.final.pdf</a>

Stephen Langella, Shannon Hastings, Ohio State University <br>
    <br>
Over the last few years there has been a great surge of interest in
grid computing and the building of 'The Grid'. The grid community
describes the grid as a world full of loosely coupled machines running
services available to users on the grid.  There has been talk in the
grid community about metadata protocols that these grid services will
adhere to.  These metadata protocols are the correct abstraction layer,
but who manages these protocols?  Who will manage the metadata
definitions and metadata that is used in the grid?   How will metadata
be defined?  How will metadata definitions be discovered and who will
have the right to distribute, store, and alter them?  How will metadata
be stored on the grid?  Doesn't it seem like the majority, if not all,
of data traveling through the grid will be wrapped in metadata? Metadata
will enable the data of the grid to be discovered, interpreted, shared,
stored, and retrieved in a machine, platform, and protocol independent
way. Won't metadata management be needed by almost every service on the
grid? Not just for protocol handling but also to represent the data that
can flow in and out of these services.  It seems like the grid will need
a set of services and protocols for which the sole purpose is to manage
both the definition of metadata as well as the metadata. This talk will
propose a set of services for managing metadata in a grid environment.<br>

Data Objects</span>, Inderpal Narang, IBM <br>
    <br>
We propose a data naming and access scheme that provides much greater
transparency of not only location and replication, but also name and
data format. We first start with a way to reference an arbitrary grid
data object and its access mechanism, independent of data type. We then
propose a scheme for object discovery where applications contact a
single Discovery service with constraints on the object content and the
quality of service. This is in contrast to current proposals for a
two-step discovery process, where applications contact a catalog service
for a logical file handle, and then contact a separate Replica Location
Service for a physical file reference. Accompanying paper: Transparent

The goal of the session is to produce a summary of the current state of
the use of databases on the grid, and to identify     areas for further
investigation and standardisation for     databases on the grid. So far
we have:

Sandro Fiore, ISUFI/CACT (Center for Advanced Computational
Technologies) University of Lecce, Italy<br>
    <br>
This is to offer an easy way to manage relational databases in the
Globus Community.<br>
                                                                                       <br>
The GRelC middleware could be very useful for deploying quickly and
easily grid-aware applications that interact with Relational Databases.<br>

on the milestones and future directions of the group. For example
should we include     XML as well as Relational models?  Does the
charter need revision?</li>
