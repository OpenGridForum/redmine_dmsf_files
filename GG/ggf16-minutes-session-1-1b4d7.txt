GGF16 ACS Session #1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date and Time: Feb 14 13:30-15:00 EET 2006
Lead:  Keisuke Fukui (Fujitsu)
Notes: Sachiko Wada (Ascade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Overview of ACS
 Material: ACS Overview, Sample AA
 Keisuke gave a brief introduction of ACS specification and a sample 
 application archive which contains AAD, CDL and JSDL.

 [Q&A]
 NAREGI: The sample AA includes only one binary. Can I include multiple binaries
       in a single AA?
 Keisuke: Yes. This is just a simplest example. 

* NAREGI-PSE presentation 
 Material: NAREGI_PSEwithACS 
 NAREGI PSE team introduced the PSE architecture, which implements an 
 Application Pool based on ACS 1.0. The presentation included a short 
 demonstration.

 [Q&A]
 Keisuke: I understand that the PSE didn't include JSDL as a part of the AA, 
       because parameters are different for each submission of the Job. 
       However, a template JSDL may be included in an AA so that user can 
       retrieve it and modify it with job specific parameters.

 Keisuke: Is there relationship between AA instances?
 NAREGI: Yes, we maintain the relationship outside of ACS repository.

 Mike: Can I obtain the source code?
 NAREGI: Not yet. But the open source will be available at NAREGI site
       by next GGF.

* Business Grid Computing Project 
 Material: ACS sample implementation by Business Grid Computing 
 Keisuke presented the overview of their implementation on behalf of Business
 Grid Computing team. No question.
