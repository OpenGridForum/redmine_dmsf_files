* RNS Specification Review

1.1.2 Junctions

Q: Type of 'EPR', 'LogicalReference' and 'TargetPath' are all
'String'.  How to mandate the syntax of the content?
A: RNS does not mandate the syntax or format for value of each
QName.

1.1.2.3 Referral Junction

C: Referral Junction can be broken.  Need to add a note in the
document.

1.1.3.2 Entry Name Restriction

D: Section 1.1.3.2.1 is based on special characters in Unix, Windows,
and Posix.  To enable a number of systems to access RNS, it is a
union of special characters in each system.

Q: How about 8.3 name implementation?
A: The 8.3 filename limitation does not affect the RNS namespace, even
for implementations that refer to 8.3 constrained filesystems.  Path
name delimitation characters strive to avoid conflict with existing
filesystem conventions, however the RNS namespace is independent of
the target filesystem (when RNS is providing namespace services to for
filesystems) limitations.

Q: Do 255 characters in length in Section 1.1.3.2.3 mean 255 bytes or
255 unicode characters?
A: 255 unicode characters.  It is for each entry name between '/' and
'/' not for an entire path name.  That should be enough.

1.2.2.2.1 Required Entry Properties

D: Why is 'TargetPath' specified by 'Absolute path'?  An absolute
path can span several RNSs.  Instead, 'relative path' is good
enough since an alias entry points to an entry within the
service.  This issue needs to be discussed further.

1.3.2.1 create

C: 'Exact one type (LogicalReference, EPR, ...' below the table
should be 'Exact one type (LogicalReference, Junction, ...'.

The whole

Q: Do you have a use case other than GFS?
A: No.  We need a use case other than GFS.
C: Andre Merzky can provide such a use case.  He will send a few
paragraphs.
