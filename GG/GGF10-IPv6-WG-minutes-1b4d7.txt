Draft Minutes from GGF10 IPv6-WG meeting on March 10, 2004
==========================================================

Chairs: Brian Carpenter, Piers O'Hanlon

Scribe: Brian Carpenter

Agenda:

  Agenda Bashing + Administrivia (5 min)
  IPR reminder
  Charter/milestones discussion (10 min)
  Java Issues Draft (30 mins)
  Guidelines for IP version independence, discussion of latest draft (10 min)
  IP version dependencies in GGF specifications, discussion of latest draft (10
min)
    Other issues? (recurring document checks?,...)

There were no changes to the agenda except a minor re-ordering. Participants 
were reminded of the GGF intellectual property rules.

The charter and milestones were briefly reviewed. In principle the WG can close
when the three current drafts have been approved and published.

Piers O'Hanlon presented the Java draft on behalf of Jim Bound.
Draft at https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/Status_for_Java_Developers_Kit_API_for_IPv6/en/1
Slides at http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/Presentation_on_Java_and_IP_guidelines_drafts/en/1

This is a first draft, but people in the room were happy for it to
be adopted by the WG. Both positive and negative comments are needed within
two weeks, so that an update version can be published for WG last call.
After eventual Steering Group approval, the document will be explicitly
communicated to the Java Community Process.

Piers O'Hanlon presented the draft on Guidelines for IP version independence,
which is in WG Last Call now. 
Draft at http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/draft-ggf-ipv6-ip-independent-guide-00/en/1
Slides at http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/Presentation_on_Java_and_IP_guidelines_drafts/en/1

Again, both positive and negative comments are needed rapidly. Once the WG is 
satisfied, the Area Directors will arrange for the draft to be read more widely 
in the GGF to check it for comprehensibility and usefulness. This document
should be required reading for all GGF specification authors. A plenary
presentation at GGF 11 was suggested.

Sheng Jiang presented the latest update of the draft on IP version dependencies 
in GGF specifications, which has passed WG Last Call. 
Draft at http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/draft-ggf-ipv6-ipv4-dependencies-survey-00/en/1
Slides at http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ipv6-wg/document/Update-of-Survey-of-IPv4-Dependencies-in-GGF-Specs/en/1

There was one comment from the Area Director, Peter Clarke, that
the introduction should mention the most common issues found, especially
the need to cite RFC 2732 (literal IPv6 address format in URLs).

After discussion it was agreed that the document should indeed be published
in its present form (referring to the state of GGF documents before GGF10).

On the question of recurring checks, the meeting felt that the document
should be reviewed to measure progress at around the time of GGF12, but
regular updates would be an unreasonable effort. If a volunteer can be found,
an on line HTML version could be kept up to date. The GFSG might choose to
create a small IPv6 Expert Group to check future GGF documents.

In view of this, and assuming no major issues arise with the three drafts,
it seems that the WG will not need to meet at GGF11.
