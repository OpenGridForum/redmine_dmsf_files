Lead:  Keisuke Fukui (Fujitsu)
Notes: Sachiko Wada (Ascade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We continued reviewing the ACS specification.

* Chapter 3 (continued)
   We continued reviewing chapter 3.
   Hiro sent comments on section 3.3.4 and we adopted the comments.
  ACTION:
  - Mike, to change the diagram simpler since we need not describe
     whole EMS architecture. (section 3.3.4)
  Issues:
  - Revisit comment S18 and S20. (section 3.2.2)
  - Decide how we can address to the naming issues in the draft, i.e. which
    of the WS-Name or EPR to be used. OGSA seems to be moving to use WS-Name
    instead of EPR but have not reach consensus yet.

* Chapter 4
  ACTION:
  - Mike, to confirm to Pete weather the description of section 4.5 replication 
     is sufficient.
 
* Chapter 5
   Steve suggested specifying an ACS Fault type as base of other faults.
   Stuart suggested that whole tree structure of AAs should be retrieved
   from Application Repository. Currently users of ACS can retrieve
   the immediate parent and children of an AA.
  ACTION:
  - Mike, to rephrase the Steve's suggestion as an remained issue in ACS-WG.
  - Mike, to rephrase the Stuart's suggestion as an remained issue in ACS-WG.
  Issues:
  - Detailed discussion about resource properties. Should we add
     manageability properties ? This is related Manageability section.
  - TBD remained that whether we should use getAAD instead of
     GetResourceProperty in order to retrieve AAD.
  - Make clear that who (ApplicationRepository or ApplicationArchive)
     sends the Notification when AA is created and updated.
