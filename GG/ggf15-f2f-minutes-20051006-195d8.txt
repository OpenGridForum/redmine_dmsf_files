* Agenda Bashing

  Hiro proposed a revised agenda for the CDDLM-EMS which was accepted
  as a starting point.
  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/GGF15-F2F-EMS-draft/en/1

** Requirements with priority (for EMS)

   - Not clear what agreement based means in the context of job types;
     needs more refinement.
   - Agreement: framework and vocabulary to describe requirements
     - Agreed to review WS-Agreement to evaluate its position.

** WS-Agreement introduction

   Presentation:
   https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/GGF15-F2F-WS-Agreement-Introduction/en/1

   - Mutual agreement or 1-way agreement? Can an agreement also bind
     the initiator?
     - It might depending on the terms. But the protocol only says
       that the responder agrees or not.
     - In that case who observes what?

   - How is an Agreement used after created? Domain specific.
     - But OGSA might have to define a specific interaction pattern
       for creation and use.
     - In some cases agreement-creation may be equivalent to job
       submission; in others it might be done as separate steps. As
       separate steps we need to define the relation between those
       steps.
       - Agreement is then a resource allocation(reservation)
       - And passed in as additional information in a createActivity
         step

   - Why is the Agreement represented as a WS-Resource? Why not a
     signed document?
     - More broadly, how it is represented and referenced?
     - And implications on multi-part agreements (requirement?)
     - Recording the allocation of resource and the requirement to
       manage its lifetime leads to the requirement to model an
       Agreement as something like a WS-Resource.

   - Two-phase commit protocol requirement
     - And whether it is a requirement on WS-Agreement in general or
       WS-Agreement application to EMS.

   - Since it is explicitly WSRF-based what are implications if there
     are other basic profiles?

   - WS-Agreement and relation with WS-Policy: None. But it could be
     combined with WS-Policy.

   Action: Set up a team to explore WS_Agreements issues more,
           especially relating to allocation and QoS assurance.  And
           come back to OGSA-WG on how to use WS-Agreement (possibly
           evolved) with EMS. Clarify
           - How WS-Agreement possibly needs to change to fit in OGSA
             EMS
           - Set the first review after 30 days; check what can be
             done.
           - Volunteers: Steven Newhouse (to lead), Dave Berry, Chris
             Smith, (Jim Pruyne; not present >GRAAP-WG to confirm)

  - (Others also planning to explore use of Agreement)
  - GRAAP-WG is also planning to submit requirements document
  - WS-Agreement spec has been re-submitted to the GGF Editor but has
    not yet entered public comment.

** Deployment and configuration requirements

   CDDLM: provisioning of any type of resource but from the point of
          view of an application (the needs of the application)
          - from some level down (the (CDL) tree) might be more static
            or can appear as a given or pre-provisioned.
          - The place where that 'line' is drawn is an abstract notion
            which may be based on a number of factors: e.g., the cost
            of provisioning, or the available number of resources,
            or...
          - The 'line' might also depend on the definition of the
            system. But CDDLM does not do resource allocation; the
            resource is allocated (by the scheduler) and CDDLM's job
            is to configure what it's given.
          - Points towards a requirement that an estimate of how long
            a configuration might take is needed to be passed between
            a scheduler(EPS) and the CDDLM engine. Such information is
            not part of CDDLM at the moment. (Not sure if this is some
            information that is best provided from 'provisioner' or
            exists somewhere in the system.)
   - Agreed that there is a requirement to provide an estimate of how
     long the configuration takes. 
     - This information may be history based and may have to be
       updated/recalculated dynamically. There may be additional
       information on quality of estimates.

   - Proposal to do exploratory work on how to map CDL to CIM and JSDL
     to CIM (information model) and how these relate to each other
     - (And to the representation of the state of the system)
     - And scheduler and provisioning decisions may be driven by some
       shared view of these.
     - In some models the CDL may be generated from CIM (also using
       some additional information)
     - Part of this work is to be done by the RM team (e.g., which
       profiles are needed within EMS)
     - And provisioner-scheduler interactions will be explored in a
       separate session

   - Action: CDDLM team volunteered to look into two issues that were
             identified as requirements and report back in an OGSA call
             1. Where to draw the line in the (CDL) provisioning tree
                (see above)
             2. How to provide the cost of configuration 

   - Optimization requirements: Agreed this is lower priority

   - Proposed that as part of prioritizing requirements might be worth
     defining an EMS roadmap and which functions (and how far) are
     defined when. (see later on for proposal)

   - Discovery: lower priority but keep on the list (need to define
     interfaces)

** Scenarios review

*** Stuart's presentation of scenarios
   
   Stuart's presentation on CDDLM, ACS and EMS scenarios:
   https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/GGF15-F2F-OGSA-CDDLM-ACS-scenarios/en/1

   - One proposed scenario is not to have ACS 'hidden beind
     provisioning/deployment but to locate it behind information
     services or data services
     - Initial diagram shows CDDLM call ACS directly
       (ACS::GetContent). This implies a relatively tight coupling of
       the two. The proposal is to decouple these further.
     - Issue: What are the interfaces that would then be required of
       EMS?
     - Interactions with container still driven by CDDLM.
   - There is still model mismatch between EMS and CDDLM, exacerbated
     by using similar terminology with different meanings.

   - Action: Agreed on two-pronged approach for CDDLM(+ACS) on one
             side and EMS on the other to describe their approaches in
             more detail and to then unify those approaches. (Note
             these are 3 separate actions.)

*** Andrew's review of EMS "Legacy application" scenario

   - A sample scenario but not all interactions are necessary
     (returned data is not discussed during meeting). Worked to add
     step numbers. (This was also refined further at the end of day 2.)

    Jay's copy:
    https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/GGF15-F2F-EMS-CDDLM-ACS-Numbered_sequence/en/1    

   - Sequence of steps:
     0. (submit job request to) JM 
     1. JM - jsdl' -> EPS
     2. EPS - jsdl' -> CSG
     3. CSG - accesses - {Information services, ACS}
        (to possibly augment information in the jsdl doc)
     4. CSG - candidate sets - EPS
     5. EPS - schedule - JM

** Proposed EMS Roadmap

   Steven N's proposal to draw up EMS Roadmap and thereby decide the
   order in which to define the necessary functions. Outline here:

   - 0.1 BES Container + Simple JSDL Activity
   - 0.2 0.1 + Delegated JobManager+Monitoring
   - 0.3 0.2 + RSS
   - 0.4 0.3 + IS
   - 0.5 0.4 + CDDLM to BES
   - 0.6 0.5 + CDDLM to Application
   - 0.7 0.6 + ACS
   - 0.8 0.7 + Allocation & Reservation
   - 0.9 0.8 + Accounting
   - 1.0 : The entire EMS(tm)
   
   Action: To expand the above to a one paragraph description for each
           bullet (Steven N). 
           Done and draft uploaded:
           https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/proposed-ems-roadmap/en/1         

* OGSA Naming

  Review of 3-level naming scheme

  1. Human (e.g., RNS)
     -----------------
  2. Abstract (e.g., WS-Names=AbstractName+EPR)
     -----------------
  3. Addresses (e.g., EPR)

  This is essentially a 2-layered architecture since 2 & 3 are
  essentially implemented in the same way (EPRs).

  - Proposal to have all references as EPRs and make more specific
    statements depending on context whether they should be decorated
    with an AbstractName.
    - References to services (parameters or returns) are EPRs or RNS
      names (something hierarchical). Or, is this anything (e.g., URI)
      that can be converted to an EPR?
      - For RNS would also need to pass in context or resolver(?)

  The group went through the exercise of doing a number of straw polls
  to identify the weight people put on various approaches.

    <<Straw polls>>
    - Agreed that we can choose MUST
    - 1. MUST EPR (majority yes; no negative votes) - passed
    - 2. MUST {EPR or URL} (yes:2; no:many) - rejected
    - 3. MUST {EPR or RNS} (yes:0; no:many) - rejected
    - 4. MUST EPR be WS-Name (yes:; no:) - rejected
    - 5. SHOULD EPR be WS-Name (yes:; no:) - ?
    - 6. RenewableReferences: MUST, SHOULD - rejected
    - 7. RenewableReferences: MAY - passed

    In summary: 
       "MUST support EPRs, may support WS-Names or RRs or other things"
         
    It seems to depend on the situation whether to use something
    beyond an EPR. Need more exploratory work to identify which areas
    would benefit from using WS-Names or RenewableReference.

    - Proposal to also just say they are EPRs that may be decorated
      (and hence be WS-Names)

    Action: WS-Address WSDL binding writeup on how it can be used to
            provide functionality similar to WS-Names. 
            - (Tom volunteered to do this by the end of the week. Done.)

  - Is an AbstractName needed as a separate field or is the WSA
    Address (To) field a URI and so can serve the same purpose?
    - Tooling assumes or implements as URL (this is a strong reason to
      define something else)
    - Spec says or recommends URI but does not mandate it
    - So a profile would still be needed to define what a WS-Name is

  - RNS document status: in 3-week GFS-WG internal review. Will also
    do a more general call and then submit to the GGF Editor.

  - WS-Naming: reviewed during GGF15. One change agreed on (allow
    multiple resolvers) and will then submit to GGF Editor.

* Resource Management

** Review of Ellen's Approach slides

  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/information_modeling_approach/en/1

  - Recap of Information and Data Model definitions
  - Profiles would be defined and owned by GGF but the model custodian
    is DMTF
  - Profile work is collaboration work---driven by the owning group
    and assisted by RM design team.
  - The concern is still that CIM is very big and it is not clear how
    doable this work is.
    - Need to get an indication of how 'heavy-weight' this work will
      be.
    - Ellen is doing some exploratory work to show what's involved

  - It was emphasized that doing a mapping of the various data models
    (JSDL, GLUE, etc) to the CIM information model doesn't mean that
    those data models go away (at least not in the short term).

** Container presentation (exploratory mapping work):
    https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/containers_and_BES/en/1

  - Reviewed Ellen's initial work to map the OGSA (not necessarily a
    BES) definition of Container
    - Still OGSA container definition is too 'abstract' or not clearly
      understood.

  - Agreed to do a BES container profile as initial example
    - Textual description of classes and UML diagram (annotated in
      such a way that their provenance is clear: CIM, GLUE, ....)
    - Volunteers: Andrew Grimshaw, Ellen Stokes, Chris Smith
    - Also need access to a Glue expert: Email Steven N and Sergio ?
      - Or the glue-schema mailing list.
      - Steven is the initial contact for Ellen

* Re-charter discussion

    Latest draft:
    https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/OGSA-WG-new-charter-draft/en/3

  - Considered and rejected changing OGSA-WG to OGSA-RG.
  - Updates per Hiro's copy of the Charter. 
  - Reconsider teleconference time slots; possibly a shifting
    schedule. 

* OGSA 1.5

  - Reviewed information services draft by Abdeslem. 
  - Andreas will merge in to the next draft.
