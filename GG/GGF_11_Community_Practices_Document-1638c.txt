   With efforts spread over countless fronts, an individual or
   single group within a life science or health care grid is
   often unaware of well-tested courses of action.

   The purpose of this document is to provide other members of
   the Life Science community involved in grid activities the
   benefit of existing experience. The ultimate goal of this
   document is to be a GGF Informational (TODO: Common Practice?)
   Document. Whether this is done within the LSG-RG or within a
   separate working group remains to be seen. Wherever it's home,
   this document will need to be reviewed and updated regularly
   to accurately reflect the "Best Practices" of the grid
   community.

   Naturally, there exists a certain level of overlap between any
   attempt to describe common grid practices. Therefore, where
   possible we have made pointers to other similar efforts within
   the Grid community.

   This document does not endorse any of the mentioned solutions,
   applications, or frameworks. Nor should it simply be a listing
   of projects by life science groups. Rather it consists of
   distilled experiences, applicable to a wide range of users and
   intended for the common good.

1. Areas

   Each of the common practices gathered in this document can be
   grouped under one or more general areas of research. In order
   to facilitate the organization of this document, those areas
   are described here. Entries should be assigned to a single
   category; additional areas of concern can be listed in the
   index. New areas or a refinement of existing classifications
   is possible at any time.

   Area: Benefits

   Description: What, in your experience, are the benefits of
   having grid resources in the life/health sciences? Is it worth
   the cost?

   Area: Creating a Grid

   Description: The basics of setting up a grid infrastructure.
   This includes installing Globus, Unicore, or any other
   middle-ware. Further,...

   Area: Data

   Description: A large issue :)

   Area: Industry Standards

   Description: Choosing and using industry standards can make or
   break a project. Which standards are a MUST, a SHOULD, or a
   SHOULD NOT?

   Area: Non-Globus

   Description: There are many projects that purposefully avoid
   the Globus toolkit. Here's why.

   Area: Security

   Description: Security is usually the Achilles' heel of many
   projects. What have you done to take care of this? Did it harm
   you that you waited until late to start securing your project?

   Area: Services

   Description: Grid services and/or services available on the
   grid. Services embody the attempt of groups to provide
   encapsulated units in the spirit of a SOA. What services can
   be provided easily? Which are already provided? How does a SOA
   force a group to think differently?

   Area: Workflows

   Description: Various groups are working on recording and
   automating the analysis of various inputs over many steps.
   Each of these efforts has its own benefits. Which do you
   choose? Can you use multiple workflow platforms
   simultaneously? Would a scripting environment work better for
   you than a visual tool?

   Area: Resources

   Description: A general listing of beneficial (or perhaps even
   to-be-avoided) resources that are available. It is not
   uncommon that a group will begin bootstrapping their own
   infrastructure without knowing what already exists. Let's help
   one another to stand on the shoulders of giants.

2.2. Data

2.2.1. Information Integrator

   TODO (Andy):
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.2. OGSA-DAI

   TODO: what type of installation do you have? With how many
   people can you share the instance? Data sizes? Are there any
   problems?
     _________________________________________________________

2.3. Industry Standards

2.3.1. HL7

   TODO (Jill?): What groups are using HL7? Has it been useful?
     _________________________________________________________

2.4. Non-Globus

2.4.1. EnSMBL

   TODO (Chris?):(http://www.ensembl.org) genome annotation
   pipeline
     _________________________________________________________

2.5. Workflows

2.5.1. Workflow Survey

   http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/swf-survey/
     _________________________________________________________

2.5.2. Legacy Applications

   The development of a workflow platform is a considerable
   undertaking. Several such projects existed before web and grid
   services and in general used a closed-world model not easily
   portable to today's SOA. These standalone applications may
   have been feature rich but in the long run suffer from missing
   out on current developments. Such legacy applications need to
   be brought into the modern world. (TODO: ibios?)

4. Groups

   During the initial phases, this document will be strongly
   linked to the groups who have submitted common practices.
   Therefore a listing of the groups who have taken part in this
   study follows. As best practices are abstracted from the
   common practices this information can be re-evaluated.

   A quick and simple method to initial make workflows available
   as services is ...

   Note: This should a subset of the POC listing available from
   the LSG-RG.
