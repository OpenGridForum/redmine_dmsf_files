 Agenda
 
 Summary of GGF8
 Review Security doc

 Review visualization services discussions
 Review scheduling services (lost it somehow - Mike Daw - Have 
 had an out of

 ACE Focuses
 
 Security Overview
 
 ACE Grid Security Document
 a lot of the security stuff is research, and hard
 comments on security document discussed	
 language generality
 document structure is difficult -- this is an 
 informative
 document, not normative
 a formal statement of scenario requirements
 comprehensiveness
 		
 high bandwidth security issues
 		
 Changing names not important, scenario specific to AG.
 
 Grid forge complexity a pain
 
 Interactive editing on section 3.4 last sentence. Comment about
 references for requirements.
 	
 Discussion of Author list, roles, and how to prune down 
 or not to.
 
 Process discussion, when waiting periods start, end. Etc.
 
 
 Summary of ACE RG Collaboration Meeting
 
 Want to create a higherarchy that allows high level tasks to be
 decomposed into services and technology requirements.
 
 Advertisement and describable services - state summary from the
 meeting, notes to be posted soon.
 	
 focus'ing on incremental goals, but no consensus has evolved
 	
 how does this overlap with workflow, comments from bob 
 olson, john
 shalf, and jason leigh.
 	
 how does ACE fit into workflow, perhaps provide example 
 work flows?
 Use cases?
 informational documents are a lot of work, value is questionable
 	
 general discussion of the future of ACE focus, what is 
 it's focus.
 	
 capabilities a place to "define" things in ACE.
 	
 How was the security document received? We have to champion the
 informational documents or they have no value.
 
 What can we get into OGSA stuff, attributes on certificates.
 	
 Access Grid is Grid - what other things are that can become ACE
 involved.
 ACE has to interact with other GGF groups; advocate 
 issues related
 to ACE's.
 	
 Vis meeting
 reducing scope progressively
 more reducing to go; need to have a sit-down this week 
 and get stuff
 solid
 who does viz want to serve?
 who's doing what, what can they contribute?
 collaboration, visualization, common data models.
 information flow, data analysis workflow, DAIS group is 
 OGSA stuff
 for data management, data virtualization, including data 
 representation.
 interoperable components in visualization
 john wants to call a meeting today or tomorrow to move 
 ahead on this
 document
 meeting after ACE before 2pm
