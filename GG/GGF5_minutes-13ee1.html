ACEgrid meeting 
 Monday July 22, 2002
 
 37 people in attendance
 
 Mike Papka
 Jason leigh
 Tom Coffin
 Rick Stevens
 
 Jason leigh gives an overview of the acerg
 Security requirements for advr env papers bing drafted
 At ggf4 listened to overview from speakers regarding scurity 
 Ace members formulated a template One track is security On 
 the other remote file data aceess remote services
 
 Session1
 Presentation
 IETF security standards
 Session2
 
 Ace2 - 7/26/02 edinburgh
 Igrid2002 9/23-27 amsterdam
 
 Goals
 Review security req docs
 produce grid working draft
 Identify specs
 Plan results of adoption at ggf6
 
 Derek Simmel  - slides
 IETF security standards applicable to advanced collaborative 
 environments They gathered case studies and developed a straw 
 man scenario The community represented by the group was then 
 relaying their findings to network protocal people? Produce a 
 document which describes in detail what is available in the 
 IETF standards
 
 Bob Olson - What can be standardized - slides
 Protocols, data formats, best practices
 
 Can ace produce these standardized specifications 
 Sdl - very readable service 
 Idl to java
 Abstract out what the essentials of the vv are before writing 
 specs What is the minimum functionality and then provide 
 services for that High level of capability originally wanted 
 Lately there is a low end push for the accessgrid ANL would 
 like to focus on more sophisticated areas of the Accessgrid 
 Would like to see another group take on the lowend John 
 Brooke University of Manchester is interested in pursuing the 
 low end j.m.brooke@man.ac.uk
 
 Which services should we be focusing on first
 Security is a very fitting one and that is focus of this 
 meeting What is the next set of services? What has not been 
 done is an analysis of what are these scenarios Like a 
 top-down scenario
 
 Do we want to find a subgroup for this?
 
 Review of documents
 Template
 Read write delete are not extensive enough - for example 
 medical data where the personal patient data needs to be 
 secured but the statistics of the data need to be used 
 Anonymity of data required
 
 Templates were used to create separate documents which were 
 boiled into a summary The point of this exercise is to draw 
 out commonalities
 
 So. what do we do now with this document.
 Roll it out as a grid working draft
 Beat on it  make suggestions - make it more complete
 Find some people to use the grid security available and 
 Jason Leigh is working with Norse Hydro and may be able to 
 use that as a example Bob Olson could be implementing this 
 with AccessGrid development The US National Fusion Science is 
 interested
 
 Bill Allcock - Grid FTP Feature Overview - slides
 http - ftp web srb and others
 2 key points
 3rd party transfers was very important and having a separate 
 control and data channel makes that easier - work on 
 something that was standardized and extended - ftp won how 
 about seperaation of data streams - for example - send all 
 this data but do not step on my video stream - working 
 
 Dave Schissel General Atomics DOE funded lab - slides
 3 large fusion experiment facilities in the US
 application
 utilizing existing fusion applications and software
 a lot of collaboration going on between the 3 sites
 rapid analysis is done between experiments
 wants to start incorporating Accessgrid into the control room 
 environment using desktop models 
 EVL is working on 5x3 lcd panel tiled wall which could be 
 used How will it be used? A lot of one to ones or many to 
 many or a mix Need more monitoring tools What kind? How much 
 time? Is the job running is it in the cue - as a project 
 manager in the long term is you want to be able to go to a 
 scientist and say you have used the machines this much We 
 have a tool we use in fusion software, which we will 
 incorporate to help with this
 
 Next GGF is a working group meeting in Chicago - would
 Like to have the documents ready to go by then
 Will also like to bring the AG documents to that next meeting 
 and Possibly to run them before that meeting
 
 The venue model is to be used not just for streaming media 
 but for other tools and shared objects for distributed computing 
 
 Backend services examples will be in the AG2
