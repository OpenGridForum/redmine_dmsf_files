   GGF-6, Chicago<br>
         <br>
   Attendees: John Towns (NCSA &amp; NLANR), Alistair Mills (RAL), Jim Guiliani 
 (Ohio SC), George Myers (NASA/Ames), Jim Ferguson (NCSA &amp; NLANR), Brian 
 Homrich (Datasynapse), Yutaka Kudo (Hitachi), Marian Bubak (ACC Cyfronet)<br>

         </p>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>John Towns initiated the meeting with introductions, plus
an  administrative update on the status of the group in the eyes of the GGF 
Steering  Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Production Grid Management group, a new
group at the GGF, has been formed as a Research Group.&nbsp; Towns attended 
one of the new group's meetings earlier in this Forum, and they intend to 
be "complimentary" to the Grid User Services RG.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>The Steering Committee is concerned that documents in development 
 are not advancing fast enough, and more effort needs to be put into the documents
 in between meetings.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>New members were brought up to date on the history of the
group,  and trying to encourage more participation (outside of the European
meetings)  of European and Asia/Pacific region members.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>Rundown of the documents currently in progress:</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <blockquote>                           
        <ul>
             <li>User Services Common Practice - nearly complete, Towns making 
 some minor mods before submittal as a final document to the next GGF meeting.</li>
                             
        </ul>

      <blockquote>                           
        <ul>
             <li>Grid Constitution - George Myers leading, we are nearly
finished  and need just a bit more content to be added.&nbsp; Possible final
document  for the next GGF meeting, worst case will be a final review session.</li>
                             
        </ul>
         </blockquote>
                                              
      <blockquote>                           
        <ul>
             <li>Trouble Ticket Interchange - previous volunteer author has 
 had health issues since last GGF in Edinburgh, and also will not be getting 
 support to attend GGF in the future, so we need a new author.</li>
                             
        </ul>
         </blockquote>
                                              
      <blockquote>                           
        <ul>
             <li>Services and Tool Requirements - not very far along, and 
previous  volunteer author has had to resign due to workload.&nbsp; We need 
a new author.</li>
                             
        </ul>
         </blockquote>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>Jim Guiliani volunteered to be the new lead author on the
Services  and Tool Requirements document.&nbsp; This document will deal with
tools and services needed by *support staff* in their everyday dealing supporting 
users on the Grid.<br>
           </li>
                       
      </ul>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>The Trouble Ticket Interchange document was left vacant for
 now. &nbsp;Hopefully we can identify a new volunteer from the readership
of these notes...or we may end up pushing this document to the Production
Grid Management group.<br>
           </li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>George Myers commenced a discussion of the Grid Constitution 
 document, on which he is the lead author.&nbsp; Discussion started with the
 current state of the document, and its organization was explained to those
 who had not seen it before.&nbsp; Discussion of the Intellectual Property 
 bullet (2.3) and its origin &amp; importance.&nbsp; Towns to provide the 
portion of the Alliance subcontracts that address this issue for inclusion 
in the document.<br>
           </li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>Alistair opined that lack of detail in some of the issues
listed  (like IPR) in the Grid Constitution doc is actually just fine, as
it should  mostly function as a 'template' for other to take and attach importance 
to  each section as applies to their current context.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>Section 3 was discussed, along with the questions submitted
 regarding that section.&nbsp; George will be converting some of the questions
 to the outline.&nbsp; A discussion about leaving the "question forma" in
the doc, or converting it over to fully statement-based doc.&nbsp; There
are good reasons to leave some sections in question format, because the sections
 make more sense in that context.&nbsp; Or perhaps we will add questions
to  each other section as we think are required.&nbsp; Document might be
more  practically useful' written with questions for the reader to consider.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>Alistair volunteered to give George an example of a real legal-eze 
 agreement&nbsp; between parties, which will perhaps be useful to point out 
 some areas where local lawyers might be interested.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>The participants thought sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all 
looked  pretty good as is.&nbsp; This should not discourage and edits from 
readers  who did not make this meeting!</li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>George will reformat and work in comments to section 3, send 
 edited version to the group and then set up a conference call to review what
 he has done.&nbsp; Target for the call will be sometime after SC02, and
before  Christmas holidays.<br>
           </li>
                       
      </ul>
                                              
      <ul>
           <li>Need to clarify deliverables for the various documents in
the  Mission statement.&nbsp; Need to have meeting minutes up on web site
within  2 weeks.</li>
                       
      </ul>
                       
      <ul>
           <li>Some discussion on sharing work on documents with the new
Production  Grid Management group.<br>
