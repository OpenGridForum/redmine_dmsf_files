* GGF14 OGSA-WG session #3: Submitted Document Discussion
=========================================================

* Roadmap document (Jem Treadwell)

  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/GGF14-OGSA-Roadmap/en/1

  - The Roadmap document is in public comment. It has now been linked
    to the GGF home page. Comment through the GGF home page.

  - No interoperability tests planned; a gap that needs to be
    addressed somehow.
    - One possibility is an interoperability workshop/test: not sure
      OGSA-WG will choose to go that way yet.

  - Who tracks and checks the status of the referenced specs?
    - Up to the person who is in charge of the each document section
      in the Roadmap.

  - Sometimes a specification is not visible because the workings of
    the group are opaque. By definition the Roadmap cannot refer to
    such documents.

  - And sometimes there is work to update a spec that is not visible
    until made public.
    - But such work does not invalidate older versions. These can
      still be used but maybe will not be adopted in the way initially
      expected.

* Profile definition (Tom Maguire)

  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/OGSA_Profile_Definition_Session_3/en/1

  - Distinction between proposed recommendation and grid
    recommendation. They define a different level of interoperability.

  - How does OGSA-WG decide the next piece of work to do?
    - It is a volunteer effort. And prioritize based on group-internal
      evaluation and what is needed.

* WSRF Basic Profile (Tom Maguire)

  https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/document/OGSA_BP_Session_3/en/1

  - (WS-I on its way to becoming an ISO standard)
  - Complete; doing final reviews.
  - Waiting for WSN BasicNotification to reach OASIS TC committee
    draft status.

  - OGSA AuthZ document is out for public comment. It is not in the
    style of a profile but it essentially defines an authorization
    profile for OGSA (based on XACML, etc). 
    - One public comment to this document might be to suggest doing it
      more rigorously as an OGSA profile.

  - GGF needs to publicise documents going into public comment
    more. One proposal is to arrange for emails to 'all' to announce
    that a document goes into public comment. (Ref: OASIS
    announcements)

  - Document characterizes specs in overall OGSA Roadmap if they
    choose to do so.

  - Meaning of profile statements:
    - If a feature described in the profile is implemented it must be
      implemented the way the profile defines. No statement on whether
      the feature must be implemented.
    - Also no statement that you can't do other things. But
      interoperability may suffer in that case.

  - Independent interoperability test for a specific spec?
    - Tests per specification can be done separately but it does not
      make any statement about the interoperability of the entire
      conformance profile.

  - Composability is an important property

  - Compliance to OGSA (which cannot be defined at the moment) might
    eventualy required compliance to one or more profiles.
