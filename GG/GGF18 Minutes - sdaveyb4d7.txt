I made a few notes from the GGF18 session but not a great deal.
My notes are:

1. Should say "Behrens" not "Berens".

2. John Huh (Kyunh Hee University, Korea, johnhuh@khu.ac.kr) mentioned that he is implementing some parts of the InfoD spec. He is using OGSA-DAI to send the data messages and is storing publishers, subscriptions etc in a Registry, but is not (as yet) matching publishers with consumers - but looking to do more. He has emailed some notes on his implementation to the infod mailing list. Has been invited to join infod mailing list.

3. Roger Barga (Microsoft, barga@microsoft.com) mentioned that the InfoD Use Cases doc on GridForge was corrupted. Ronny & Stephen then attempted to fix it but were unable to re-load a copy of the doc to any GridForge folder without it being corrupted. So doc was emailed directly to Roger.
He was also keen to get involved with the group and has been invited to join infod mailing list etc.

Cheers, Stephen.
