The CMM-WG will have two half-day sessions in GGF9, which will
act as a mini face-to-face meeting. The agenda (still
preliminary) is:

(a) Early discussion (attendance list, note taker assignment, etc.)
(b) Introduction and updates (for people not attending teleconferences)
- Introduction to CMM
- Update on WG activities and status
- Updates and discussion on the relationship with other
  standards bodies (mainly, with OASIS WSDM).
(c) Face-to-face meeting
- Review and discussion of the community practice document
- Technical work session on port type specification

     The times are given below. This will give people time 
to think, write text, etc. overnight.
