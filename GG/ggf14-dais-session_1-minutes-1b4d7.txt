GGF13 DAIS Session 1
====================

Norman Paton opens the session.

This session will cover:

       Review of progress
       Review of the WS-DAI specification

Following session will cover:

       WS-DAIR
       WS-DAIS
       WS-DAIO

Group has been going for quite some time. BOF at GGF4.  Published
GGFD.13. Hope to submit core specs in July 2005 (or well before
GGF15).

Submitted specs for GGF14 rather late as we were trying to get the
documents as close to final submission as possible.

Some of the changes in WS-DAI have not quite propagated to the
realisation specs.

Have taken long as we have trying to work out our scope and
dependencies. Started using OGSI. Scarred by the OGSI experience. Not
all DAIS participants/vendors are committed to WSRF.

Also, WSRF is not suitable for all data resources nor do they map
naturally. Have spent a considerable amount of time trying to explore
the mapping options.

Now have a core that does not have a dependency on WSRF. This has a
fair amount of functionality but not soft state management and other
things that would be gained through the use of WSRF. Hence have
introduced a layer over a core set of functionalities that do not have
a dependency on WSRF.

Susan Malaika now takes over to present the present status of the
WS-DAI.

(content is mainly as those in the slides presented)

Dave Berry: My memory of the GGF13 DAIS session where the conduit was
            introduced was that the DBMS was the conduit and the
            tables and other things were managed by DAIS.

Dave Pearson: the DBMS was acting as a conduit...

Susan: that was the idea in Seoul but it has evolved since then.  We
       are trying to take into account which objects are managed by
       DAIS and which are not. Also trying to create a framework that
       works with both WS-DAI and WSRF.

Dave Pearson: in your slides you said that the data conduit is
              optional and that it allows you to access WSRF and
              non-WSRF service. Are there any limitations in not using
              the conduit?

Susan: one of them is the way that you deal with properties - without
       WSRF you have one operation to get the whole property document
       you do not have a finer granularity of access ...

Bruce Barkstrom: this appears to be written in the context of DBMSs -
                 what happens with data in very large collections that
                 have very large files. What do you do with that?

                 Also, in your data catalogue do you allow for the
                 inclusion of remote catalogues - for instance
                 external libraries and references to other
                 catalogues?

Susan: first dealing with large resource - you can define an interface
       that allows you to get pieces of your data back at a time
       ... our intent that this is flexible.


Bruce: Earth sciences calls that a subset within a file and you would
       not not use a query to extract this information but a function.
 
       You also have supersetting - where you collect pieces of data
       together and put them together and send them back, e.g. in
       meteorology you could extract pictures of hurricanes from
       images kept in different files and stored in different
       locations. Do you support this?
 
Jon Myers: I am from the DFDL group - have been looking at the XML
           realisation - if you have a DFDL description that maps over
           multiple files you could use this to provide this kind of
           behaviour ...

Susan: so what you are saying is that you can describe the whole file
       system as though it were a single document - a view - and this
       view mechanism might provide a way of looking at many files in
       different locations in a file system to present a global view -
       is that right?

Jon Myers: yes

Susan: for the catalogue part of the question ... you asked if we
       could deal with a distributed catalogue - the catalogue could
       be a real catalogue or a distributed catalogue ... we only
       describe the interface ... have a catalogue interface what data
       you have access to

Bruce: it is not the distributed part but the granularity of the
       description that concerns me - in the previous example the
       hurricanes are not in the catalogue - these were determined by
       a data mining application that found these hurricanes and
       created a new catalogue containing this information ...

Susan: you need to look at the specifications to see if it satisfies
       your requirements...

Norman: I would have answered the question differently - the word
	catalogue is misleading.... nothing to stop people from
	defining registries our catalogue only defines the resources
	that the services have.  It could be generalised but I would
	not use it that way ...

Susan: so maybe catalogue is not such a good name ... it only has a
       list of names that are accessible through the service

Savas: when you presented the conduit you suggested that it is
       optional - is the design of the conduit optional or is it in
       the implementation technology that is optional?

Susan: I would say it is optional in the architecture ... it is there
       to have lifetimes managed and finer grain access to properties
       ..

Savas: to introduce an artifact in the technology only to add some
       capabilities does not seem productive to me ....

Susan: it makes it possible for people that do not want to use WSRF to
       use DAIS ...

...

Savas: I understand the design decision ... I would prefer the conduit
       to be part of the architecture. If you use WSRF then every
       message is directed through the conduit but in the case where
       you do not have WSRF then the name becomes the conduit.

Susan: the name is always there ..

Savas: if it is not the name that identifies the conduit then what is
       it? ... it is the operations that you get through WSRF - you
       have a WSRF way of manipulating things...

...

Savas: there is a 1-1 association between a conduit and WSRF?

Susan: yes ...

Norman: a conduit is a WS-Resource ... we don't like the name conduit

Savas: I thought the conduit was introduce to allow different
       implementations to be used but it now only seems to be there if
       you want to use WSRF .....

       Not objecting to the use of WSRF ... I'm making the point that
       from a design point of view you are introduce a concept to only
       use WSRF when you can use WSRF without using the conduit.

Norman: the question that Savas is asking is mainly a presentational
	one as opposed to a disagreement in the content of what is
	being said ...

...

Savas: if you were to tell me that every message had to go through a
       conduit to identify the resource then I would have understood
       what you meant ....

...

Norman: if you use WSRF, you have an EPR that identifies the resource,
        which then gives you the option as to whether you include an
        abstract name in the messages or not.  It is the case that the
        type of the messages is the same whether you use the conduit
        or not ... if you pass a name to something that is uniquely
        identified by WSRF then passing that name is unnecessary but
        still possible. You could mandate that you always pass a name
        even in WSRF which means .... the client code used will look
        the same for both cases .... so we could require a name in
        every case ...

...

Susan: we do not mandate the names in WSRF operations only in the DAIS
       operations ...

...


Paul Watson: wish to applaud the effort of the group - what you have
             come up with is pragmatic and workable. The next thing is
             best practice - people will want to use this ... they may
             over use some of the features - for instance the dynamic
             way of creating data resource. I see why this is useful
             but I feel it could be badly used - sky query have a
             similar framework - use select into which allows you to
             keep it in the data resource and that offers large
             advantages .... Allows you to address Bruce's question
             but if someone reads the spec they might think too much
             about creating data resources ... the suggestion would be
             to come up with a best practice document.

Greg Riccardi: if one said create a data resource - a sensible is to
               do a create table from select ... the data resource
               does not have to be created it can just be a create
               view ... the implementation could do this ...

Dave Pearson: the spec is providing generic capabilities .... For
              instance the JSDL people could say that you could do
              this by submitting a JSDL document ... the best practice
              guide would be a good idea ... but until the
              implementations come out it's difficult to state what
              best practice is ...

Dave Berry: maybe there is a research project ...

Bruce: is it worth talking about scenarios in this context ...?
