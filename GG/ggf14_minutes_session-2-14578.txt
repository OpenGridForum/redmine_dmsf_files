GGF14 ACS Session #2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date and Time: June 30 11:00-12:30 CDT 2005
Lead:  Keisuke Fukui (Fujitsu)
Notes: Sachiko Wada (Ascade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 11:00 Agenda bashing

* 11:05 Relationship to OASIS SDD TC
  After SDD TC status update from Tom, we discussed the form of the 
  relationship between ACS and SDD. 
  - Agreed to have official liaison with OASIS SDD TC.
  - SDD includes a notion that can be translated into Application Deployment 
    Descriptor (ADD) which may be contained in Application Archive (AA).
  - ACS should gather requirements for ADD and provide them to SDD.
  - There is a schedule mismatch.
    SDD held a first meeting on 1 June and will continue working
    on use cases for a couple of months, while ACS plans to write up the 
    final (or at least close to final) draft until next GGF. We'll find
    how we can fit these each other soon.

* 11:18 Glossary definition refinement
  Material:"d1Glossary"
  We read through the proposed glossary document.  
  - The glossary was approved as the baseline to continue discussion.

* 11:40 Continue work on Repository interface
  Material:"ACS-ARI"
  We discussed about the proposed ARI specification. 
  The following comments were made, but we only cover the first few pages 
  during the session. We agreed to continue discussion over the mail and 
  teleconferences, toward the face-to-face (F2F) in August.
  - Section 1.1 should be move to the introductory part of the draft doc.
  - Need more discussion on the role "Replicator". This is connected to the
   "Transfer" operation. Use case approach may be desired on this issue.
  - Data Transport. We will utilize existing data transport protocol for
    Register(or Create), GetContents operation. A mechanism for protocol
    selection is expected.
  - We have two types of reference for external reference here: A reference 
    to be resolved by ACS and a reference to be resolved by consumer; we 
    should check the contents for the former when the actual file is 
    retrieved (= when a reference is resolved). For the latter, however, we 
    cannot ensure the reference is valid since the it may be changed over the 
    time and we don't know when it is resolved.
  - We will continue discussions about the interface name; Register or Create.

* 12:15 Next step
 - Agreed to have F2F meeting early in August.
 - Next regular call is on 6 June.

* 12:40 End of session
