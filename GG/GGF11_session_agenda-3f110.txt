The CMM-WG will have two sessions in GGF11:

- The first session Heather Kreger, co-chair of OASIS WSDM (Web Services Distributed Management), will introduce WSDM  to the GGF membership. WSDM will be used in OGSA as an important component in resource management.

- In the second session Fred Maciel will present the CMM-WG gap analysis results. We will also discuss how to continue our work.

There will be also two cross-WG sessions (WSDM-CDDLM and WSDM-OGSA-CMM) to discuss the relationships between these WGs.
