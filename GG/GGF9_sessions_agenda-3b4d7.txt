The CMM-WG will have two half-day sessions in GGF9.

The outline and objectives of the sessions are:
(1) Give an update of the WG activities for those not participating regularly,
  in the beginning of the first session, in standard GGF session format.
(2) Discuss the collaboration between the CMM-WG and OASIS WSDM TC on
  the remaining time (recent activities in the WSDM TC have a lot of commonality
  with the OGSI/CMM work, so both are now re-directing the activities to cooperate).
  This will be a face-to-face meeting of the CMM-WG, of interest
  mainly to those participating regularly in the WG activities. (Two half-day
  sessions were allocated instead of a full-day session to give people time 
  to think, write text, etc. overnight.)

The expected outcome of (2) is a decision on how we are going to collaborate with
the WSDM TC, and the future scope and activities of CMM-WG in relation to that,
probably including a new charter.

The agenda (still preliminary) is:
