GGF12 OGSA EMS design team session #1
=====================================
note taker: Hiro Kishimoto, Andreas Savva

Sept. 21 (Tues), 9am-10:30am, VUB D005

* Early discussion

- IP Policy note
- Agenda

* OGSA v2 process by Hiro

Hiro gives general (not EMS specific) explanation of process and
deliverables of the series of OGSA v2 documents.

Ramin (GSA-RG co-chair) explains the work of GSA-RG.
Hiro: What's your definition of "schedule"

Ramin explains their (broader) definition of schedule, it includes
brokering, reservation, local and global scheduling.

Hiro shows OGSA demand-supply diagram and asks GSA-RG if it is
compatible to their view

GSA-RG says some terms in the diagram has no definition, thus it is
unclear what they mean.

* EMS presentation by Ravi

** Job explanation (p11)
   - Relationship between job and task
     - Ramin: Does job consist of multiple tasks?
     - Ravi: Yes, it does.
     - (Note: Ravi's explanation is that job contains 'tasks'; this is
       not the same 'task' term used in v1 so it is confusing)

   - Why make a distinction between job and workflow? From the
     client's point of view the job even if it is a workflow is a
     'single' job.
     - Working definition of (OGSA) 'job' is different

   - Specific interfaces not described; still at abstract level
   - JSDL does not describe job state; only describes the job
     description at submission time

** Job manager (p12)

   - Why is job manager a proxy for job?
     - Job manager can manage collection of jobs
     - Q: Can workflow manager be a JM?  Ravi: Yes.

     - JM is optional; don't need to have it for every job
     - Job grouping can be based on some property (e.g., jobs belong
       to a workflow) or could be some user defined grouping. 
     - But these are different functionalities, even though the i/f
       might look very similar.

     - GSA: Current EMS architecture seems to depend too much depend
       on existing schedulers.
       - Hiro: We start from existing ones but make it generic.

   - Definition of job manager seems overly complex; proposal to
     simpify by specifying only the minimum required functionality
     first
     - E.g., drop stuff like 'can provide job steering...'
     - Just a job factory and collection portypes; not yet a service
       (that is implementation)

** Services to manage/driver resources (p13)

   - Why does it include job steering/scheduling functions
     - Why is it different from 'scheduling' e.g., preemption
     - Introduce the idea of being able to modify the schedule plan
       during execution; after the initial schedule is formulated

   - Why is this separation of functions necessary (eps, csg)?
     - It is possible to have various interfaces implemented by a
       single service; specify them separately to allow various
       compositions

   - Candidate set generator
     -  Does not include temporal constraints; split up to 'identify'
        separate phases
        - But in practice these phases are closely intertwined; there
          is an iteration between the static & dynamic phases
     - Probably documentation gives the wrong impression; phases are
       not expected to be separated in an airtight manner.

GGF12 OGSA Information services design team session #2
======================================================
note taker: Hiro Kishimoto

* Naming service by Andrew

Andrew goes over his slides; terms, transparency, and properties.
He says our problem is not so much technical as political;
Every SDOs and industrial players, e.g. IBM, HP, MS, DMTF, OASIS,
WSDM, need naming service for distributed computing and they are under
developing their own naming services. Since it is so important, it is
not easy to agree on single naming services.

Rough consensus is: Attaching statement about "check it if ok or not"
to Andrew's naming document and bring it to them.

A.I. Andrew will update his doc and sends it out to the list (DONE).
