The CMM-WG will have two sessions in GGF11:

- In the first session Heather Kreger, co-chair of OASIS WSDM
  (Web Services Distributed Management), will introduce
  WSDM  to the GGF membership. WSDM will be used in
  OGSA as an important component in resource management.

- In the second session Fred Maciel will present the CMM-WG
  gap analysis results. We will also discuss how to continue
  our work.

There will be also two cross-WG sessions (WSDM-CDDLM
and WSDM-OGSA-CMM) to discuss the relationships between
these WGs.
