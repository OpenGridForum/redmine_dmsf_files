Notes on othe Grid High Performance Network BoF 
GGF3 Frascati October 2001

        Scribe:       Richard Hughes-Jones

The Group organised 2 sessions:
At the first session there were presentations on :
Lambda Switching by Cees deLaat 
Network performance measurements by Eric Myers
An initial discussion of the Charter

The second session focused on the Charter.

The following are a summary of the overall discussions on forming the Group:

* There was general agreement that the group should be a GGF Research Group,
  as there are several interest/work areas and the topics were not all suitable
  for the 6 month time-frame common for GGF Working Groups.

* The GGF Research Group should be formed before the next GGF meeting in
  Feburary 2002. 
* In light of the discussion of each of the interest areas, summarised below,
  details of e current proposed Charter will need to be changed. It was agreed to do this by e-mail.

* It was agreed that Network Monitoring would be the responsibility of the PERF Network Monitoring Group.

* Network security has two main areas:-
	o Authentication and Authorisation matters - would be covered by the
          GGF AAA group.
        o Line security and data encryption - the group would keep a technical
          watch on IPsec and IPv6. It was clear that there was a Grid requirement
          for data security and documents specifying the requirements and best
          practices were needed.

* No formal working groups were created, but several people were already
  active in the areas of High Performance Data Transport and QoS/Bandwidth
  Reservation. It was agreed to have two serial BoF on these topics at the
  next GGF.


Discussisioof possible Work/Study areas:

1. High Performance Data Transport
   All agreed that the Grid needed to move data as efficiently as possible 
   - A Grid Requirements document is needed. Several people were 
     investigating TCP over the current networks e.g.
      - toto determine what is wrong with TCP now
      - the effect of the end-systems and monitoring tools.
      - how does it alter on Gigabit networks
Suggestions for techniques and work/tests will be circulated.
It was agreed that the definition of new protocols / extenstions to TCP/IP was
the work of the IETF, but the GGF could provide input.

2. QoS/Bandwidth Reservation

Several people were doing research work and it is very useful to exchange ideas.
It is important of identify the QoS requirements from the Grid users and the
middleware. Bandwidth Reservation goes with QoS to support it. There is a need
to define a globally accepted scheme that network providers could supply.
GARA and the Q-Bone were briefly discussed.

3. Lambda Switching

Lambdas are at Level1, users at level 5-8. It was anticipated that users would
ask for bandwidth from the Grid QoS middleware agents, and these agents would
request lambdas. It was agreed as a technology watch task with regular updates.

4. MPLS 
As per item 3. - a technology watch task.

5. Multicast

Useful for data replication as well as real-time (audio/video) grid applications.
The Grid requirements for reliable data replication and real-time data moving
need to be specified. A watch should be kept on the IETF reliable multicast group.

6. Liaison 
  	
Agreed it was very important to have links with external groups.
e.g. IPv6 - Grid APIs should be v4 and v6 compliant.
 Liaison could form a software technology watch task.
