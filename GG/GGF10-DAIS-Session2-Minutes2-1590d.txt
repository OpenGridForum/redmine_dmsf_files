DAIS Session 2
--------------

Minutes by Norman Paton

Dave Pearson:
-------------

Provided an overview of activities in the group, sessions, and documents
produced for GGF10.

Simon Laws: Core specification
------------------------------

Provided a reminder of the basic interaction patterns DAIS has been focusing
on.  Gave high-level overview of the core specification, based on OGSA Data
Services, and the two realisations for XML and relational data access.

Reviewed active topics (Data management, data movement, transactions, etc).

Behaviour and Control: Initially focused on operations rather than semantics
of the operations.  Now seeking to define some terms that characterise the
semantics of the services. 

Terms for access:
- access modes
- concurrency of operation calls
- concurrency of data access
- holdability (from JDBC)
- sensitivity to expernal change (from JDBC)
- type mapping - types/rounding/faults
- partial data - are partial results acceptable
- maximum data size - maximum size for binding

Not yet clear which ones should have defaults, which should be negotiable, or
how exactly some of them interact.

Indepral Narang: what about result format?  It happens that this is already a
settable property.

Factory terms:
- materialisation - on create/on access
- lifecycle - destruction criteria/inactivity sessions
- relationships - behaviour of parent/child relationships

Inderpal Narang: does the latter relate to provenance.  It wasn't especially
the idea, but it could play such a role.

Notification terms:
- granularity
- sensitivity

Issues for base specification:
- do we have the functions correct?
- do we have the right metadata?
- how does the base map to infrastructure?
- what is the overlap with information dissemination?

Question: is there a realisation for object databases?  Not actively underway,
but if there was interest in developing such, that could be done.

Brian Collins: Management
-------------------------

Background: discussion from last GGF to the effect that not capability of the
different specifications not quite the same.

Data services specification indicates that language strings are likely to be
passed through to an underlying data resource; this could allow various forms
of management to take place through the data access portType.

What constitutes data management?

Data Access and Integration: What and Where.
- DML: act on the database extent.
- DDL: act on logical schema.

Data Management (Data Administration).
- Specify when, why, where.
- DDL: acting on physical schema.

Inderpal: How would one represent federated case - one logical schema derived
from many sources?

Dave Pearson: Could conceivably provide terms to restrict access, characterise
the number and relationship beween schemas.

Inderpal Narang: Could conceivably have logical schema in one paradigm and
physical in another.
