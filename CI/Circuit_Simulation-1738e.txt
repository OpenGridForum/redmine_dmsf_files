Introduction:----------------    2.1 Provide a paragraph introduction to your use case.  Background      to the project is another alternative. (E.g. 100 words).  We have developed our application in SCILAB because it is a free and an open environment with numerous primitives (linear algebra, graphical subroutines...), and because it is a very interesting environment for prototyping rapidely new applications in our domain. Our needs relies on the use of the ASP possibilities from SCILAB.   2.2 Is there a URL with more information about the project ?  No    3. Use Case to Motivate Functionality Within a Simple API:----------------------------------------------------------      Provide a scenario description to explain customers' needs.  E.g. "move  a file from A to B," "start a job."    Please include figures if possible.  If your use case requires multiple components of functionality, please    provide separate descriptions for each component, bullet points of 50  words per functionality are acceptable.    Analysis of the topology of the circuit made of transistors, linear elements, generators. For I=1 to number of transistorsCall "The Physics based simulator" in order to fill in the Jacobian matrix of the problem.Assembly the global matrixAdd the contribution of linear elements and generatorsSolve the sparse problem.  4. Customers:-------------  Describe customers of this use case and their needs. In particular,  where and how the use case occurs "in nature" and for whom it occurs.    E.g. max 40 words  The use of tools in a friendly environment like SCILAB    5. Involved Resources:----------------------  5.1 List all the resources needed: e.g. what hardware, data,      software might be involved.  PC under Linux, HP workstation    5.2 Are these resources geographically distributed?  No, but may be in the future    5.3 How many resources are involved in the use case?  E.g. how      many remote tasks are executing at the same time?  8 or 16 is a good value, but the same program is called (Physics based Simulators)    5.4 Describe your codes and tools: what sort of license is      available, e.g. open or closed source license; what sort       of third party tools and libraries do you use, and what is       their availablility;  do you regularly work from source       code, or use pre-compiled applications; what languages       are your applications developed in (if relevant), e.g.       Fortran, C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python.  C, C++, SCILAB, Librairies : TAUCS, UMFPACKS, ARPACK, LAPACK, BLAS, SCALAPACK    5.5 What information sources do you require, e.g. certificate      authorities, or registries.  I don't understand this question    5.6 Do you use any resources other than traditional compute       or data resources, e.g. telescopes, microscopes, medical       imaging instruments.  No    5.7 How often is your application used on the grid or grid-like       systems?      [ ] Exclusively      [ ] Often (say 50-50)      [x] Ocassionally on the grid, but mostly stand-alone      [ ] Not at all yet, but the plan is to.  6. Environment:---------------  Provide a description of the environment your scenario runs in,  for example the languages used, the tool-sets used, and the user  environments (e.g. shell, scripting language, or portal).  SCILAB  7. How the resources are selected:----------------------------------  7.1 Which resources are selected by users, which are inherent       in the application, and which are chosen by system      administrators, or by other means?  E.g. who is specifying       the architecture and memory to run the remote tasks?    It must be transparent for the users or the developers      7.2 How are the resources selected? E.g. by OS, by CPU power,      by memory, don't care, by cost, frequency of availability      of information, size of datasets?  By CPU power and memory available, depending of the size of the problem      7.3 Are the resource requirements dynamic or static?  dynamic    8. Security Considerations:---------------------------  8.1 What things are sensitive in this scenario: executable code,       data, computer hardware?  I.e. at what level are security       measures used to determine access, if any?  Maybe executable code    8.2 Do you have any existing security framework, e.g. Kerberos 5,      Unicore, GSI, SSH, smartcards?    No      8.3 What are your security needs: authentication, authorisation,      message protection, data protection, anonymisation, audit       trail, or others?  I don't know for the moment but maybe authorization    8.4 What are the most important issues which would simplify your      security solution?  Simple API, simple deployment, integration      with commodity technologies.    No response    9. Scalability:---------------  What are the things which are important to scalability and to what  scale - compute resources, data, networks ?  Compute ressources  10. Performance Considerations:-------------------------------  Explain any relevant performance considerations of the use case.  Access to a very fast sparse solver for very large system  11. Grid Technologies currently used:-------------------------------------  If you are currently using or developing this scenario, which grid  technologies are you using or considering?  ASP (client/agent/server) with DIET    12. What Would You Like an API to Look Like?--------------------------------------------      Suggest some functions and their prototypes which you would like  in an API which would support your scenario.For sparse Solver : possibility to select a preconditioner (for symmetric or unsymmetric matrix), the matrix format(matrix market or Harwell Boeing)For the Physics based server : input is a text file which allow to fill the matrix of the problem    13.
