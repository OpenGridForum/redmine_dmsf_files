Grid Resource Allocation Agreement Working Group (GRAAP-WG)Session minutes OGF 24September 15-19, 2008SingaporeMinute taker: Philipp WiederGRAAP Session #1--------------------------[Details see slides on GridForge [1]]- IPR. Participation list.- Status Quo + Experience document is not yet written. + Some progress with the negotiation protocol. + In general not much progress.- Comment from Area Chair (Ramin) + GFSG asks whether it is possible to specifiy the common subset for the main WS-Agreement use case: advance reservation. Recommendation would be good for upcoming implementations. - A (Wolfgang): Could be difficult. + In addition, the question has been raised whether it is possible to describe in the experience document all WS-Agreement parts which have been used and how.- A (Wolfgang): That is easy. [NOTE: Resulted in a questionnaire [2] sent to WS-Agreement implementers] + Nothing like an interop. event is needed to prove interoperability. + Résumé: Two documents are needed:  (1) Experience document for becoming a recommendation. Questionnaire [2] asking some implementers (around 4) how they use WS-Agreement.  (2) Making a proposal for using WS-Agreement for Advance Reservation of computational jobs.Questionnaire [2]:- Use case description (maybe from the survey paper [3])- Background information + project timeline + date of implementation + website- Hosting Environment- WS-Agreement rendering + which parts of the template are used/supported  * start with Dominic's document template  * portTypes to be added. Ask for additions to the protocol  * Ask also for extensions to the template/data structure + Template(s), Agreement example + send questionnaire to known implementations (deadline two weeks from now)Session #2---------------[Details see slides on GridForge [2]]- IPR. Participation list.- Discussion on negotiation.- Existing agreement is the context of the re-negotiation.- Wolfgang takes notes directly within the slides. Please refer to [4] for discussion results.- Proposal (Oliver): Client & provider have to share template type system- [Action]: Ask BREIN guys whether they are ok with this changes- Next steps: + Create new Agreement factory interface inheriting from the old one + getQuote + New Agreement state: superceded (adding superceded will result in a loss of backward compatibility) [NOTE (Email from Oliver to GRAAP list "Extension of agreement states for WS-Agreement-Negotiation"): It turned out that this is NOT the case.]---[1] https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc15359?nav=1[2] https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc15358?nav=1[3] Seidel, J.; Wäldrich, O.; Ziegler, W.; Wieder, P. & Yahyapour, R.: Using SLA for resource management and scheduling - a survey.
