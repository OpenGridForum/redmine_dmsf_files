GRAAP F2F Outcome
-----------------
- GRAAP held a F2F in Dagstuhl, Germany, March, 2009
- See slides for details [2]
- Input to (re-)negotiation, term languages, etc. have been discussed

WS-Agreement Negotiation Protocol
---------------------------------
- Protocol finalised as discussed at OGF 25
- Presentation by Angela Rumpl [3] on implementation in SmartLM
- Will be an extra OGF document. A draft is scheduled for end of June 2009.
- The current implementation contains a term language on licences which is 
of interest to the community at large. It is recommended to provide it 
as an experiment document to OGF.

Advance Reservation (AR) Profile for WS-Agreement
-------------------------------------------------
- Presentation by Oliver Waeldrich [4]
- The use case here is a job submission with an inherent reservation request.
- Q (Chris): What about the more low-level AR scenarios where you reserve a slot and
then submit jobs into it? - A (Oliver): This case has not yet been followed. Maybe in 
the context of the Scheduling Description Term Language?

Discussion on Term Languages
----------------------------
- There has been an extensive discusison on term languages at the F2F. Lots of
sugegstions have been made and actions assigned, but not all things have 
been delivered yet.
- Add all information to the Wiki!
- Expression Term Language
	+ Action (Philipp): Remind Bastian, Michael and Donal regarding their
	input to the WSLA discussion
	+ (Oliver) Maybe the whole discusion is obsolete since JEXL can do the job. 
	It is used as the expression language in the AR profile and will be documented
	there.
- Web Services Term Language (see [2])
	+ No actions yet, seems to be low prio. On hold.
- Economic Data Term Language
	+ Thomas Quillinan is working on that
	+ He will provide a use case and a survey paper on that as input to GRAAP.
- Security Term Language
	+ On hold.
- Networking Term Language
	+ Use case exists. Input from VIOLA & PHOSPHORUS projects.
- Economic JSDL Term Language
	+ Action: Chase responsible person.
- Parties Term Language
	+ Action: Contact Dominic

Discussion on Scheduling Description Language
---------------------------------------------
- (Chris): It seems that most of the terms there make sense, but providing a 
specification with agreed upon semantics might be very difficult.
- Agreement: Discuss the time-related issues in the context of the AR Profile, GSA-RG 
and the German DGSI project. Apart from that, GRAAP is not the right place for the SDL 
discussion.
