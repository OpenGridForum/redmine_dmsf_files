<p><a name="login">How do I obtain a GridForge login?</a></p>
<p>Browse to <a href="http://forge.ggf.org/">http://forge.ggf.org</a> and select 
  the &#8220;Create New Account&#8221; link in the top right of the page. Fill 
  out the form and press the &#8220;Register&#8221; button. You will receive a 
  confirmation email at the account provided in the form. Press the confirmation 
  URL in the message and you will be officially registered. Remember your login 
  name as it will be required to join a GridForge project. </p>
<p><a name="join">How do I join a group project?</a></p>
<p>First, you must have a GridForge login and password. Follow the directions 
  to obtain a login in these FAQs. Once you have a valid login, you can send an 
  email with you login name to the group chair or designated administrator of 
  the GridForge project you wish to join. After the administrator adds you to 
  the project membership and assigns a role, you can use the tools available within 
  your group&#8217;s GridForge project.</p>
<p><a name="mypage">Where can I go to see a summary of my projects and the trackers or document 
  releases that I am monitoring?</a></p>
<p>When you initially login to GridForge, you are presented your &#8220;My Page&#8221;. 
  This page shows you all the projects to which you belong as well as any trackers, 
  forums, or file releases you may be monitoring. The &#8220;My Page&#8221; link 
  is always available at the top of any GridForge page.</p>
<p><a name="finddocs">How do I find and download documents?</a></p>
<p>The first question to answer is, &#8220;What sort of document am I looking 
  for?&#8221; If you are looking for GGF documents (draft or final), then you 
  must visit the Editor project and click on the Document Manager link. Otherwise, 
  you must determine in what project the desired document resides. Typically, 
  group drafts are in the Document Manager of the group&#8217;s project. So, to 
  find the latest draft of the OGSI working group, use the search feature (top 
  right of any page) selecting &#8220;GGF/Area&#8221; from the drop-down and &#8220;ogsi-wg&#8221; 
  for the search criteria.. This should result in a clickable link to the project. 
  Once in the project, you can go into document manager and navigate to the document 
  you wish to view. In some cases, drafts that are nearing completion may be stored 
  in a file publisher package. Instead of selecting Document Manager within the 
  project, simply select File Publisher from the left nav bar and find the document 
  you are looking for. Selecting the title of the document will initiate the download 
  procedure. You can also use the search mechanism at the top of any GridForge 
  page to search for document titles. Select &#8220;Documents&#8221; from the 
  first drop down and type in some or all of the title. A hit list will be returned 
  with matches.</p>
<p><a name="subdoc">How do I submit a document?</a></p>
<p>First, you must decide into which project you will submit the document. If 
  the document is for a working or research group, then navigate to the appropriate 
  project. Once in the project and assuming you have the appropriate role to do 
  so, submit a document by selecting the &#8220;Submit&#8221; link under Document 
  Manager on the left nav bar. Once the submit document form appears, you first 
  browse and select the document you wish to submit. Note that you may also paste 
  non-binary document text into the Paste Document pane on the form and not use 
  the browse feature. Next select the type of document (PDF, DOC, etc.). Take 
  care that there is not a mismatch in the type of document as this will result 
  in an error. Next, fill in the document title (mandatory) and description. Leave 
  the Paste Document pane empty if you have browsed and selected a document. Select 
  the access type, category (folder) into which the document will be placed, and 
  the language of the document. Select the appropriate check boxes for locking 
  and reviewing (by administrator only!), and take care to read the Acceptable 
  Document Usage information and checking its check box (mandatory). After the 
  form has been fully filled in, press the &#8220;Add File&#8221; button. Note 
  that if you successfully submitted the document, a URL for the document will 
  be presented at the top of the form. If this URL is not present, you will likely 
  have an error message (in red) toward the top of the form indicating something 
  did not submit correctly and you must repeat the process.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="viewtracker"> How do I view a tracker?</a></p>
<p>Navigate to the project containing the tracker you wish to view and expand 
  the tracker list on your left nav bar. Select the tracker you wish to view and 
  a list of items will be displayed.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="montracker">How do I monitor a tracker item?</a></p>
<p>Navigate to the project containing the tracker you wish to monitor and expand 
  the tracker list on your left nav bar. Select the tracker and a list of items 
  will be displayed. Click on the item of interest and when the tracker item page 
  appears, click the &#8220;Monitor&#8221; button on the top of the page.</p>
<p><a name="createtrack">How do I create a tracker item?</a></p>
<p>Navigate to the project containing the tracker into which you wish to create 
  a tracker item. Expand the tracker list on the left nav bar and press the Submit 
  link immediately below the tracker name. Fill out the form and press the &#8220;Save&#8221; 
  button at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p><a name="filttrack">How do I filter tracker items so that I am seeing only those items I wish to 
  see?</a></p>
<p>In a long list of tracker items, it is advantageous to create a filter so that 
  only the pertinent items are displayed. For example, one could set up a filter 
  to view only those items with an &#8220;open&#8221; status. To set up a filter, 
  navigate to the tracker item list by selecting the Tracker name in the left 
  nav bar of the project. At the top of the form are several drop downs that allow 
  you to filter your items by various criteria. Select the criteria and press 
  the &#8220;Filter&#8221; button. Note that the filter remains in place in subsequent 
  visits until you press the &#8220;Reset Filter&#8221; button.</p>
<p><a name="viewdoc">How do I view a document that has been published within a project?</a></p>
<p>Most groups use the Document Manager tool to submit and manage their documents. 
  However, when a group has published a final GGF document it may choose to use 
  the File Publisher tool for the permanent storage of the final document. If 
  you cannot find the document in the project&#8217;s document manager, select 
  the File Publisher link on the left nav bar and attempt to find a package named 
  similar to the document. Select the package and a list of available files (e.g., 
  documents) will be clickable from there.</p>
<p><a name="findforum">How do I find the project forums?</a></p>
<p>Navigate to the project containing the forum you wish to view. Select the Forums 
  link in the left nav bar. This results in a listing of various forums within 
  the project.</p>
<p><a name="partforum">How do I participate in a forum?</a></p>
<p>Depending on what role you have been assigned and how the project administrator 
  has set up the forum, you can participate in a forum by simply navigating to 
  the project containing the forum, expanding the Forum list in the left nav bar, 
  and clicking on the forum in which you wish to participate. Find a message that 
  you wish to reply to or you may start a new thread. Make sure you are logged 
  in because many forums do not allow anonymous posting. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="findproj">How do I find a project?</a></p>
<p>GridForge has two methods of finding a project. The first method is using the 
  search mechanism at the top of any GridForge page. In the GGF implementation, 
  you would typically select &#8220;GGF Area/Group&#8221; from the first drop 
  down, type in some portion of the name (preferably the GGF short name like ogsi-wg), 
  and press &#8220;Go&#8221;. A list of results is returned and you can scroll 
  down to find the project you are looking for (note: you may have to go to a 
  second or third page).<br>
  If the search method does not work, you can go to the GGF GridForge Site Map 
  located under the Global Grid Forum GridForge Directories link on the left nav 
  bar. Once at the site map, you can browse by Type (e.g., WG, RG), Area (by selecting 
  the GGF Areas link under Browse by) or by Process and Management (by selecting 
  the link under the Browse by heading). Browsing these trove lists should result 
  in finding the project you are looking for.</p>
<p><a name="findpers">How do I search for a person with a GridForge login?</a></p>
<p>Using the search mechanism at the top of any GridForge page, select &#8220;People&#8221; 
  from the first search drop down then type in the name of the person you are 
  looking for and press &#8220;Go&#8221;. A list of &#8220;hits&#8221; will be 
  returned.</p>
<p><a name="docsearch">How do I search for documents?</a></p>
<p>You can use the search mechanism at the top of any GridForge page to search 
  for document titles. Select &#8220;Documents&#8221; from the first drop down 
  and type in some or all of the title. A hit list will be returned with matches.</p>
<p><strong>General Gridforge Processes</strong></p>
<p><a name="submitdraft">How do I submit a draft to the GGF Editor for review?</a></p>
<p>When GGF documents have gained consensus within a working group or research 
  group, then the draft document may be submitted to the GGF Editor for review 
  and processing. Assuming the draft has all the prescribed components (http://www.ggf.org/documents/default.htm) 
  then submit the draft using the following form: https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/index.php?func=add&amp;group_id=90&amp;atid=414. 
  Carefully read the directions and fill out the form, attaching the draft (in 
  an acceptable format) and press &#8220;Save&#8221;.</p>
<p><a name="pubcom">Where do I find a document that is available for public comment?</a></p>
<p>Currently, GGF is listing their public comment documents on SourceForge.net 
  (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ggf). Browse to that site to view documents 
  in the public comment period.</p>
<p><a name="finaldocs">Where do I find the final GGF document set?</a></p>
<p>Currently, the final document set is found at: https://forge.gridforum.org/docman2/ViewCategory.php?group_id=90&amp;category_id=28.</p>
<p><a name="docprocess">What is the standard GGF document process?</a></p>
<p>The GGF website contains a process overview (http://www.ggf.org/documents/default.htm) 
  which references GFD-C.1, the GGF document that provides the details of the 
  process. Portions of the process, both public and administrative, have been 
  automated by the GridForge tools. </p>
<p><a name="member">How can I participate in a group&#8217;s GridForge project?</a></p>
<p>See the <a href="#join">above directions</a> on becoming a member of a GridForge project.</p>
<p><a name="minutes">Where can I find meeting minutes for a group?</a></p>
<p>Groups may post their meeting minutes in different ways. The two practices 
  most used are managing minutes using Document Manager and using a Forum thread 
  for each meeting. In either case, navigate to the project and use those two 
  tools to determine where the group posts their minutes.</p>
<p><a name="wgdraft">How can I access a draft document that has not yet been submitted to the GGF 
  Editor?</a></p>
<p>Typically, draft documents not yet submitted to the GGF Editor still reside 
  in the group&#8217;s project. It may be either in the Document Manager or in 
  the File Publisher tool. Navigate to the group&#8217;s project and explore both 
  of those tool repositories.</p>
<p><a name="areas">Where can I find out more about the GGF areas and existing groups?</a></p>
<p>You can browse the GGF GridForge Site Map (https://forge.gridforum.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php).<br>
  Once at the site map, you can browse by Area by selecting the &#8220;GGF Areas&#8221; 
  link under the Browse by heading. Each Area will have a listing of Projects 
  its working and research groups.<br>
