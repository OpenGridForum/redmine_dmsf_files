<p><a name="admin">How do I become the administrator of my project?</a></p>
<p>A GGF site administrator must grant you the role of project administrator manually. 
  Submit a request to the site administrator using the following tracker: <a href="https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/index.php?func=add&amp;group_id=111&amp;atid=615">https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/index.php?func=add&amp;group_id=111&amp;atid=615</a>. 
  Make sure you are logged in prior to submitting the tracker item. Alternatively, 
  if your project already has a project administrator, that person may also grant 
  you the role of project administator.</p>
<p><a name="projopts">How do I manage project options (e.g., turn on/off tools available within a 
  project)?</a></p>
<p>Press the &#8220;Edit Project Info&#8221; link (in left nav bar under Admin) 
  and toward the bottom of the resulting page, you will find a list of Active 
  Features (i.e., tools). Simply select the tools you wish to use or not use and 
  press the Update button. Note that mailing lists and SCM are not currently supported 
  in the GridForge implementation.</p>
<p><a name="auditlog">How do I view a project audit log?</a></p>
<p>The project audit log gives you the ability to see the changes that have been 
  made to the project and the user who made them. Underneath the Admin link on 
  the left nav bar, a link for Audit Log is available for project administrators. 
  Press this link to view the project audit log.</p>
<p><a name="addmem">How do I add a new member to my group?</a></p>
<p>Adding members is a three step process. First the individual must obtain a 
  login by registering with GridForge (link on front page). During this process, 
  the user will obtain a login name (also known as a &#8220;short name&#8221;). 
  Next the project administrator navigates to the Project Administration Summary 
  page by clicking the Admin Project link on the left nav bar. On the bottom of 
  this page, the Add Member pane offers a text box into which an administrator 
  can type the login name of the user to be added and press &#8220;Add to List&#8221;. 
  If the login name is a valid GridForge user, then the user is added to the list 
  of new members to be added. The third step is to assign a role to the new member. 
  Normally, new members are assigned the role of GGF-Group-Member. This is done 
  by selecting the &quot;GGF-Group-Member&quot; role from the &quot;Assign Users 
  to Roles&quot; selection box. When a role has been selected and the Add Member 
  button pushed, the user(s) in the list are added to the project with the selected 
  role. </p>
<p><a name="memroles">How do I manage member roles?</a></p>
<p>Administrators may change the role of project members at any time. To change 
  a member&#8217;s role, navigate to the Project Administration Summary page by 
  clicking the Admin Project link on the left nav bar. At the bottom of the page 
  is a list of project members. Select the &quot;Edit&quot; link next to the member's 
  role you wish to change. Select the appropriate role on the next screen and 
  press &quot;Save&quot;. </p>
<p><br>
 <a name="adminrights"> How do I give an existing member administrative rights to my project?</a></p>
<p>To change a member&#8217;s role to Project Admin, navigate to the Project Administration 
  Summary page by clicking the Admin Project link on the left nav bar. At the 
  bottom of the page is a list of project members. Select the &quot;Edit&quot; 
  link next to the member's role you wish to change. Select the &quot;GGF-Project-Admin&quot; 
  role on the next screen and press &quot;Save&quot;. </p>
<p><a name="frontpage">How do I update the project &#8220;front page&#8221;?</a></p>
<p>On the left nav bar under &#8220;Admin&#8221;, press the link entitled &#8220;Project 
  Info.&#8221; You will be presented a page with a Description pane containing 
  the html code for the front page. This can easily be cut out and pasted into 
  an html editor of your choice (for more wholesale changes) or one can make the 
  changes to the code in the pane. Once the changes have been made (either by 
  pasting back the updated code from your editor or by making the change directly 
  in the pane), press the Update button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><a name="addfold">How do I add folders and subfolders in the document manager?</a></p>
<p>Folders and subfolders are called categories in GridForge. To add a category, 
  press the Doc Manager link on the left nav bar under Admin. The resulting page 
  will have a series of panes, each of which serves a different purpose. To add 
  a new category, use the top pane. Type the name of the new category, then select 
  the parent category into which the new category will be created. In the current 
  GridForge implementation, the category entitled &#8220;Root Category&#8221; 
  would be considered your &#8220;root&#8221; or top-level category. Selecting 
  a different category as the parent will result in a sub-folder being created 
  with the name specified. After providing the category name and selecting the 
  parent category, press the &#8220;Add Category&#8221; button.</p>
<p><a name="delfold">How can I delete/hide a folder or subfolder (category)?</a></p>
<p>To delete or hide a folder, press the Document Manager link on the left nav 
  bar. Once the folder &#8220;tree&#8221; displays, navigate to the folder you 
  wish to delete or hide. Click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; link next to the folder 
  you wish to delete or hide. Once the edit category page appears, you may select 
  the status you wish, either hidden or deleted. Note that changing the status 
  of a folder to deleted also results in deleting the documents contained in the 
  folder.</p>
<p><a name="submitdoc">How do I submit a document?</a></p>
<p>To submit a document to a project, you select the &#8220;Submit&#8221; link 
  under Document Manager in the left nav bar. Once the submit document form appears, 
  you first browse and select the document you wish to submit. Note that you may 
  also paste non-binary document text into the Paste Document pane on the form 
  and not use the browse feature. Next select the type of document (PDF, DOC, 
  etc.). Take care that there is not a mismatch in the type of document as this 
  will result in an error. Next, fill in the document title (mandatory) and description. 
  Leave the Paste Document pane empty if you have browsed and selected a document. 
  Select the access type, category (folder) into which the document will be placed, 
  and the language of the document. Select the appropriate check boxes for locking 
  and reviewing, and take care to read the Acceptable Document Usage information 
  and check its check box (mandatory). After the form has been fully filled in, 
  press the &#8220;Add File&#8221; button. Note that if you successfully submitted 
  the document, a URL for the document will be presented at the top of the form. 
  If this URL is not present, you will likely have an error message (in red) toward 
  the top of the form indicating something did not submit correctly and you must 
  repeat the process.</p>
<p><a name="deldoc">How do I delete a submitted document?</a></p>
<p>To delete a document, use Document Manager to navigate to the document and 
  press the&quot;Details&quot; link associated to its title. When the document 
  form appears, press the &#8220;Delete&#8221; button at the bottom of the form. 
</p>
<p><a name="movedoc">How do I move a document?</a></p>
<p>To move a document, use Document Manager to navigate to the document and press 
  the &quot;Details&quot; link associated to its title. When the document form 
  appears, press the &#8220;Move&#8221; button at the bottom of the form. Select 
  the target category (folder) to which the document is to be moved and press 
  the Move Document button. Note that prior to moving a locked document, you must 
  unlock it.</p>
<p><a name="lockdoc">How do I lock or unlock a submitted document?</a></p>
<p>To unlock a document, use Document Manager to navigate to the document and 
  press the &quot;Details&quot; link associated to its title. When the document 
  form appears, press the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button at the bottom of the form. 
  To lock the document, select the Lock check box toward the middle of the form 
  and press the Update Document button at the bottom of the page. To unlock, simply 
  deselect the Lock check box and press the Update Document button. Make sure 
  you deselect the &quot;Create New Version&quot; check box, which is selected 
  by default.</p>
<p><a name="limitdoc">How do I manage/limit who can see a submitted document?</a></p>
<p>Each submitted document is given an Access Type which dictates what role is 
  required to view or edit the document. To change this Access Type, use Document 
  Manager to navigate to the document and press the &quot;Details&quot; link associated 
  to its title. When the document form appears, press the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button 
  at the bottom of the form. Select the appropriate role from the Access Type 
  drop-down and press the Update Document button at the bottom of the page. </p>
<p><a name="addtrack">How do I add a tracker?</a></p>
<p>Press the Tracker Admin link in the left nav bar (under Admin). Fill out the 
  form and press the Submit button at the bottom. Note that you may place HTML 
  in both the &#8220;Submit&#8221; and &#8220;Browse&#8221; panes for better formatting 
  of the forms.</p>
<p><a name="trackopt">How do I manage tracker options such as days until considered overdue, expiration, 
  email addresses, canned responses, and field value lists?</a></p>
<p>Press the Tracker Admin link in the left nav bar (under Admin). Select the 
  link associated to the name of the tracker to be updated. Select the link representing 
  the tracker options you wish to change (e.g., Update Preferences). Update the 
  tracker options and press the &#8220;Submit&#8221; button at the bottom.</p>
<p><a name="createpkg">How do I create a package for file publishing?</a></p>
<p>Press the File Publisher Admin link on the left nav bar (under Admin). Click 
  the Create New Code Package link, fill out the name and status, and press the 
  &#8220;Create&#8221; button.</p>
<p><a name="hidepkg">How do I hide/unhide a package?</a></p>
<p>Press the File Publisher Admin link on the left nav bar (under Admin). Click 
  on the title of the Package to be updated. Select the appropriate Status from 
  the drop-down and press the Update button.</p>
<p><a name="pubfile">How do I publish a file?</a></p>
<p>In order to publish a file (e.g., a near-complete draft GGF document), you 
  must first create a package into which the file will be placed. After creating 
  a package, navigate to the package by pressing File Publish Admin on the left 
  nav bar (under Admin). Click on the package into which the file will be placed. 
  Fill out the form, browse to the file to be published and when complete, press 
  the Create Release button.</p>
<p><a name="createfor">How do I create a forum?</a></p>
<p>Press the Forum Admin link on the left nav bar (under Admin). Select the &#8220;Add 
  Forum&#8221; link and fill out the resulting form, pressing the &#8220;Add this 
  forum&#8221; button when complete.</p>
<p><a name="chgfor">How do I change the preferences of a forum (e.g., turn off anonymous posting, 
  etc.)?</a></p>
<p>Press the Forum Admin link on the left nav bar (under Admin). Select the &#8220;Update 
  Forum Info/Status&#8221; link. Find the Forum you wish to change, make the desired 
  changes and press the &#8220;Update Info&#8221; button next to the forum being 
  updated..</p>
<p><a name="delfor">How do I delete a forum?</a><br>
  Press the Forum Admin link on the left nav bar (under Admin). Select the &#8220;Update 
  Forum Info/Status&#8221; link. Find the Forum you wish to change. To delete 
  the Forum, select the &#8220;deleted&#8221; check box and press the &#8220;Update 
  Info&#8221; button next to the forum being updated.</p>
<p><a name="delmsg">How do I delete a message within a forum?</a></p>

  message to be deleted and click on the Subject link (not reply). This will display 
  the message and the message id should be seen on the line after the Date line. 
  Once you have the message id, press the Forum Admin link on the left nav bar 
  (under Admin). Select the &#8220;Delete Message&#8221; link, insert the message
