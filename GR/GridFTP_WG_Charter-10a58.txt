At this stage, the group should focus on improvements of FTP and GridFTP v1.0 protocol with the goal to produce bulk file transfer protocol suitable for grid applications. New protocol should be backward compatible with RFC959 FTP as much as possible with new features added as (negotiable) extensions. Some desired extensions are: 

* Parallel transfers 

* GSI authentication 

* Striped transfers 
 

 
Goals and Milestones:

* Publish GridFTP v1.0 protocol document as an official
  GGFdocument - by GGF8 

* Collect and discuss list of improvements to 
  GridFTP v1.0 - by GGF9 

* Produce GridFTP v2.0 protocol definition draft 
  document - by GGF10 

* Implement GridFTP v2.0 client and server and document 
  the implementation - by GGF10 

* Produce GridFTP v2.0 protocol document - by GGF11
