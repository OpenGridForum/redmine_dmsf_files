<h1>List of suggested GridFTP v1.0 improvements</h1>
<dl>

<dt><b>Uni-directional data transfer in E-block mode</b></dt>
<dd>
As it is described in GridFTP v1.0 draft document, due to
possible race condition, in E-block mode, data connection
establishment must always originate at the data source
side. This means that data retrieval must always be
performed in server-active mode and data storage - in
server-passive mode. This makes it hard to use E-block
mode in presence of firewalls, NAT, etc.
<p>
Possible solutions to this problem are:
- negotiation of number of parallel data connections ahead of
time
- modifications of E-block mode protocol
</dd>

<dt><b>Ordering of PASV/SPAS and STOR/RETR commands</b></dt>
<dd>
This problem is inherited from RFC969 FTP protocol. The thing
is that in passive mode, server must reply to PASV command
with address of data socket before it receives STOR or
RETR command. In case of distributed server, this is not
always possible. This makes it very difficult to implement
passive mode in distributed FTP server in scalable way.
<p>
There are many possible solutions of this problem:
<ol>
<li>Introduction of PRET command as discussed in GridFTP v1.0
document which would carry attributes of the file which is
about to be transferred and issuing PASV right after PRET
<li>Delayed passive option for PASV command which would allow
to defer answer to the PASV command until STOR/RETR is received
and include data socket address into (unused) answer to
STOR/RETR
<li>Introduction of new pair of commands, GET and PUT which
would essentially combine functionalities of (1) and (2)
into single command/reply and presere semantics of STOR/RETR
</ol>
</dd>

<dt><b>Possible disconnection of idle control channel socket by
some firewalls</b></dt>
<dd>
This problem is inherited from RFC969 FTP protocol. Some
firewall software drops idle TCP connections. In some
applications, such as disk cashe in front of tape storage,
data existing in name space is not always readily accessible.
In these cases, the client must wait for relatively
long time before data transfer can even start after issuing
the STOR/RETR command. This makes the control channel socket
connection idle for long time, and the firewall can drop it.
The same may apply to data channel as well.
<p>
Solution for control channel seems to be easier than for
data channel. Performance data proposed in GridFTP v1.0
draft can be periodically sent over the control channel
to keep it alive.

As for data channel, some sort of keep-alive noise could be
sent in the direction opposite to data transfer.
</dd>

<dt><b>Unreliable EOF communication in Stream mode</b></dt>
<dd>
This is inherited from RFC969 FTP protocol.
As specified by the RFC, during data upload, the server is
supposed to treat end of data socket as end of file.
This makes it impossible for the server to distinguish
between normal end of file and abnormal client shutdown.
<p>
Possible solution for this problem is to introduce
mandatory EOF command which would be sent by the client
to confirm that the entire file was sent successfully
over the data socket.
</dd>

<dt><b>Data integrity verification</b></dt>
<dd>
In order to protect data from transmission errors,
some data integrity verification mechanism should be introduced on the level
of FTP protocol, in addition to TCP packet checksumms.
Some sort of CRC or another form of digital signature should be
calculated either over each block of data in block-oriented transfer
modes such as Block and Extended Block or over whole file in Stream mode.
</dd>

<dt><b>Control of types and frequency of feedback from the server</b></dt>
<dd>
Currently, the performance markers come at a fixed 5 second interval and
restart markers come at a predefined block size.  We should allow the interval
between restart and performance markers to be set.  Optionally, we may wish to
allow this to be extensible so that other transfer event data could be
returned as well, for example if the end host was a mass storage system and it
were staging a file, it might send back ETA or % done markers.  
<p>
Possible solutions would be to use FEAT/OPTS mechanism or introduction
of new command (tentatively TREV for or TRansfer EVent).
</dd>

<dt><b>Structured directory listings</b></dt>
<dd>
Incorporate the MLST and MLSD commands as specified in  
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-16.txt">
Extensions to FTP</a> Internet Draft.  Investigate structured stat command.
</dd>

<dt><b>IPV6 support</b></dt>
<dd>
Consider endorsement of the EPRT and EPSV commands as defined by 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2428.txt?number=2428">RFC 2428</a>
</dd>
