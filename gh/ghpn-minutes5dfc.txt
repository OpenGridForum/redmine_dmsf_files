Grid High Performance Networking Research Group
Meeting March 16th, OGF28 Munich

The documents are not clearly organized, this should be improved.
Richard will take this up with Cees.

Victor Reijs presented the Stitching Framework

Afterwards there were some questions:
How do the paramaters relate to the WS Agreement?
Not clear yet, must be investigated.
Unfortunately there was not any time left. Further discussion is moved to the mailinglist, and Victor will organize a Skype conference call for those interested.
