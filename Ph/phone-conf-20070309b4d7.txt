** Agenda

*** (a) RUS&UR OGF19 issues and roadmap discussions, including charter issues
    Short summary about the planned developement of the RUS specification.
    More information can be found in the Roadmap on the RUS gridforge.
    Follow the idea of the ByteIO specification.
    
    ACTION: Morris and Gilbert will go over the group Charter and submit it
            to the AD as soon as possible.

    ACTION: Morris will put the OGF19 slides on the ogf website asap.

*** (b) Short news about the recently published UR spec.
    UR specification is published, a next revision is planned.
    The group needs to recharter itself, this is planned for OGF20.
    There were quite a few public comment but most of them were out of scope
    for the current specification, however they are still in the tracker on
    the gridforge.
    However aggregation and VO level properties will be in scope for the next
    UR revision. Especially aggregation requirements will be in scope for the
    OGF20 discussion. One important aspect is what types of aggregation users
    are talking about, since there seems to be different ideas. Also UR 2 will
    consider records for information other the computational jobs.

    ACTION: Donal will make the new UR schema available on gridforge
    ACTION: Donal will investigate how to publish the schema on schemas.ogf.org


*** (c) Discussions&summary about RUS-18 spec revised by Xiaoyu Chen
    Presentation is available on the rus gridforge (under documents).
    Update of the used UR schema and of the Update methods.
    Donal suggested the creation of an experiences document to collect the
    experiences with the current RUS draft. In a first phase this also could
    be done on the Wiki to keep a low profile.
    Also VO level aggregation within RUS should be investigated since VO
    properties are currently not part of the UR specification.     

    ACTION: Xiaoyu will upload the draft 18 version of the RUS specification on
            the gridforge.
    ACTION: Xiaoyu will evaluate VO level issues in the context of the advanced
            RUS specification.

*** (d) Mapping work on specs/charter to people

    ACTION: Donal will investigate on aggregation issues for the UR session.
    ACTION: Morris will follow up on one page RUS issues summary action from 
            OGF19.
    ACTION: Charter work see under (a).
    ACTION: Gilbert will start working on the IDL RUS core specification.
    ACTION: Morris will start working on the RUS core WSRF rendering.
    ACTION: Xiaoyu will start working on the RUS core WS-I rendering.
    

*** (e) Planning for OGF20 sessions

    3 sessions were requested for OGF20:
