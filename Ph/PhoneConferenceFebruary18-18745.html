<P><FONT size=2>Working Agenda: </FONT></P><B><U>
<P><FONT size=2>1. Detailed feedback on the foundation document 
</FONT></P></B></U>
<P><FONT size=2>Additional comments? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Use cases: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan proposes retaining all 6 pieces, but wants to converge 
down analysis. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Wants for everyone to look at their contrib and eliminate 
overlap. Could we reorder them? </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT size=2>David is going to merge use cases</FONT></B><FONT size=2>. By 
starting with the first use case and show how successors differ. If there is 
anything specific to an individual scenario, it should be drawn out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>OGSA F2F discussion raised the question 'what services do we 
offer'? Sometimes it has been presented as Compilation, Deployment and lifecycle 
management. Dejan proposes that deployment is core. Lifecycle management 
overlaps w/ OGSA PE. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stuart: difficult to do deployment without the means to describe 
what you are trying to do, and the means to configure components. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan thinks that WSDM can handle GM configuration. We should 
only handle configuration for deployment. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Steve: thinks that live reconfiguration is something for 
management &amp; not for CDDLM as it is too tied in with system management. But 
acknowledges that you cannot statically configure everything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Jun: provisioning and reconfig should be required for OGSA in 
total, so it has to be implemented in the pieces, which means CDDLM will need 
it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan: points to CDDLM and Provisioning doc on the site. Base 
question: do we agree fundamentally with limiting to deployment. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stuart: too much is unclear. We cannot hand off the language to 
WSDM. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan clarifies -that live system management is the scope of 
WSDM. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stuart: we need to look at the architecture and define the 
service interfaces, what it is that post messages and listens for things. By 
defining CDDLM we will be making requirements for WSDM, because the Job Manager 
will need to talk to the CDDLM system to find out what resources are needed for 
a job. Stuart is nervous that we havent started to evolve our integration with 
the rest of OGDA/WSRF/WSDM &amp;c. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan clarifies that we only offer one service 'deployment'. 
There is no compilation per se, just configuration, and lifecycle mgt is handed 
off. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Are there any disagreement with this?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>steve; if we have to rely on something else for lifecycle 
management, we will be tightly coupled to something else in OGSA PE. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan: to revise the foundation doc by drawing in the slide from 
p3 of "CDDLM vs Provisioning", clarify the core role of CDDLM as deployment. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Are there any other showstoppers? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Still some issues to do with bootstrapping that dejan will 
discuss w/ Steve. </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Deadline: Monday for doc; Friday for feedback to 
Dejan</FONT></P></B><B><U>
<P><FONT size=2>- Feedback on the SF-based language spec</FONT></P></B></U><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Steve to pick up on missing pieces: schemas, predicates, 
predefined functions. </FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT size=2>Dejan asks if it is ready to ship to the editors. As a 
non-normative spec, it is pretty good. We need to specify the matching from this 
to the XML. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stuart: more explicit examples. Need to tie in the language to 
uses, so that readers will get a sense of value. Wants the value of the language 
to be tangible, and for that binding to be in there. </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Steve to do this. Also to raise w/ patrick the extends {} 
construct. </FONT></P></B><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Deadline: Monday for doc; Friday for feedback to 
Dejan</FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P><B><U>
<P><FONT size=2>- Feedback on the XML-based language spec</FONT></P></B></U>
<P><FONT size=2>issues: lifecycle management and reconfig, assertion language. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Jun to send out an email to the group with the 
issues.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stuart: the two languages appear to parse down differently. Its 
OK to have constructs in one that is not in the other. But does an attribute map 
from a smartfrog attr -the implied semantics have to be the same, even if the 
syntax is different. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>David: propose that an example should show how they are related. 
Likes the finite state diagram. </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Jun is preparing a (very preliminary) document from the slides, 
for March. Earlier is good for reviews. </FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P><B><U>
<P><FONT size=2>- Relationship between CDDLM and Program Execution, report by 
Kojo from the OGSA-WG F2F Meeting</FONT></P></B></U>
<P><FONT size=2>At the meeting. Andrew Grimshaw showed an object design for PE, 
'deployment and provisioning' was one of the bubbles in the design. They view 
deployment is just 'installing', not configuring and running. </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT size=2>Want to get PE and WS-Agreement in with our sessions; we should 
get into theirs.</FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT size=2>- Advance planning of the GGF10 attendance and CDDLM activities, 
approval of the agendas</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>- Various</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Jun: opportunity to discuss w/ resouce management. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Steve: WS-RF: opportunity for discussion over 
beer.</FONT></P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>
