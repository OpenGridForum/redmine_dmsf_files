<h3>Clarifications: </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
We noticed at GGF5 that there was some confusion over the scope of the WG.
It seemed that it would be helpful for us to make some clarifications to
our scope.  Following discussions (at meetings and on the list) since then,
we have come up with some (hopefully helpful) statements:
<ul>
<li>
We are not working on a co-scheduler or super-scheduler, although the
protocol could
be used (as an enabling technology) by a co-scheduler.
<li>
For now, GRAAP-WG will consider the reservation of timeslots on computational
resources as the key use of the protocol.  We hope, in time, that the protocol
can be used for other resources, such as networks, but from a discussion
at GGF6 we realised that there are complex issues regarding network reservation.
 Although we will try and be as
general as possible, we cannot take all possible uses for the protocol into
account.
<li>
The group is not currently working on a Resource Description Language, and will
not be for the near future.  Our protocol will need to communicate in some RDL
(or perhaps several), but we will wait and see if a suitable RDL emerges from
the community.  In the meantime, we may well produce some requirements
for a suitable RDL.
</ul>
