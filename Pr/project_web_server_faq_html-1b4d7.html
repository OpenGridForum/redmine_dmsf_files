<p>Project Web Server has not
yet been populated for this project. Instructions for getting started are
below.</p>


<p><b>What is Project Web Server?</b></p>

<p>Project
Web Server allows users to upload web pages to SourceForge projects. This will
enable the projects to have their own websites.
<br>
SourceForge
supports a Web-based Distributed
Authoring Protocol (WebDAV) Server. WebDAV is a set of extensions to
the HTTP protocol that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on
remote web servers. The purpose of WebDAV is to provide file I/O through HTTP.
This permits you to load, edit, delete, create subdirectories, and manage files
located on the Web Server from the client desktop.
<br>
To
use Project Web Server you must have a WebDAV client application
that supports the WebDAV protocol.

<p><b>How can I upload web pages into the Project Web
Server?</b></p>

<p>Properly
permissioned users can upload files using WebDAV-enabled client applications,
such as MS FrontPage and DAV Explorer. To install and use DAV Explorer:
<br>
DAV Explorer can be
downloaded from the following URL: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/</a>.
<br>
Install and run the DAV
Explorer. Note: An Install.txt
document (available with the tool) will guide you at the time of installation.
<br>
Within the DAV Explorer
you will see a text box (below the menu), where you have to enter the following
URL - &lt;Server Name&gt;/upload/&lt;Project Short Name&gt;. Click the icon, to
the left of the text box.
<br>
You will be shown a
pop-up where you have to enter your user name/password. Enter your SourceForge
username/password.
<br>
Upon logging in, go to
the menu and click File - Write File, to upload files. However, make sure that you have a file
by the name index.html, in the files you upload.

<p><b>How can I view a Project Web Site?</b></p>

<p>Once a project web site has been created, it can be
accessed by:
<br>
Clicking the link, Project Web Server on the left navigation within a project in SourceForge.
<br>
Typing in the URL directly:https://&lt;server name&gt;/web/&lt;project
short name&gt;/index.html
<br>
Clicking the Project
Web Server  Browse link in the project summary page.

<p><b>Why can't I upload files to the web server?</b></p>

<p>You
may not be properly permissioned. To
upload files to the web server, you must be assigned to a role with the PWS
File Upload permission. Project administrators can modify your permissions for
this project.</p>
