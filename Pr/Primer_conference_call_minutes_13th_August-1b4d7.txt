Regrets:



1. Review of minutes from the call on 6th August.
   (unable to post the minutes on Gridforge)


2. Process/management issues:

   None

3. Questions/discussion/new text
    
   o New ServiceData material is posted in Gridforge.
     - Format of Servicedatavalues which is sent in response to findservicedata and notification subscription is the same and 
       the primer should demonstrate that there are two ways (pull and push) to get the same info.
     - Discussion of the reasoning behind the mutability=constant declaration of ogsi:interface.
     Karl Czaikowsky may be able to provide the rationale: Tim will post a question to OGSI-WG.
