   NB:
     - Use of URLs to locate the document is dangerous - each new updated generates a new URL.
     - Document can be 'locked';  this informs the group that a copy of the document has been taken
       for update. Needs to be carefully observed!!

3. Questions/discussion/new text

    o Meaning of nillable: 
      - based on xsd's 'nillable': defines an extension to a type; a new value of xsi:nill can be used as the SDE value
      - the meaning of nil is dependent on the context, eg for handleresolverschemes it means 'any'.
      - sometimes, minoccurs=0 is an arguable alternative to nillable.

    o Semantics of extensible operations- where should these be defined/how used?
      - Definion of the semantics for an extensibility value should be in the wsdl for a service which exploits it,
        or in a document referenced by the WSDL.
      - Most likely, the extended portType will use a 'standard' behaviour employable in many portTypes. 
         (otherwise, the portType may define its own operation explicitly)
         Most likely, therefore, extensibility will be used to incorporate behaviour in portTypes defining or defined by extension.

        


 Outstanding assignements

    o Security Issues, Section 12 - Krishna Sankar (not present)
    o Handle Resolver - Savas Parastatidis (no input needed, Making progress)
    o Clarify semantics of destroy - Tim Banks
      - Clarified the reason for ambiguity in ServiceNotDestroyedFault - this does not reveal the
        reason for the refusal to destroy, since the reason may be due to authorization failuire and therefore 
        reveal security info.
    o Section 7 gridService portType- Tim Banks (No input needed, making progress)

  
Next call - 4pm UK time, Wednesday July 16th (and weekly thereafter) using the same number (020 7162 2149). No passcode needed.
