OGSI-WG Primer Session GGF9 October 8, 2003

1. IPR Policy and Welcome

2. Note taker D. Snelling

3. Savas: Review of primer process and status

   - Many chapters ready for final review.
   - Schedule for release at end of December
   - Ready for full community input.
   - Current version of Gridforge.

? Have we approached the community for non-expert review? Yes we will but not yet.

? What is the target audience? Grid service builders, but not developers of OGSI implementations.

We need to track a version number in the PDF document.

We need to make the Word version public access.

? Are there examples? No only the "counter" example. The primer is not actually a tutorial, but a tool for understanding.
