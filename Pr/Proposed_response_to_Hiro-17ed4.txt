Removed from the cover page.
It is intended to indicate the internal revision during the review process.

Trademark statement is inserted.

Removed the \\\"policy rules\\\" from the description.

Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter which is non-normative. It is not intended to precisely exhaust all the out of scope items. We decided to keep the original
text.

Changed \\\"Grid\\\" to \\\"Grid application\\\" so that it makes sense.

Changed section title and description to improve readability.

Instead of refer each document name, replace the sentence as below:
The service must be implemented as an OGSA service based on profiles developed by OGSA-WG.

AAID is a producer provided information and specified in ACS, while WS-Name should be provided by ACS repository. We assume that use of the WS-Name should be specified by other specification than ACS itself.

The document have below text in Chapter 5, while we decided to keep the text 
in section 3.2.1. as it is.

5.1.4 Other requirements for the ACS implementation
To be conformant to OGSA WSRF Basic Profile, the ApplicationRepository MUST implement the following portTypes.

5.2.5 Other requirements for the ACS implementation
To be conformant to OGSA WSRF Basic Profile, the ApplicationArchive implementation MUST implement the following portTypes.

Changed text to address this comment as below:
ACS provides an extension point for protocols which allow implementations to specify which protocols are supported. The ACS team has reviewed briefings and draft documents developed by data-releated WGs in GGF such as OGSA-DATA, OGSA-ByteIO, GridFTP.

Changed text to address this comment as below:
The ACS specification leaves the manageability aspect to the standards set by external references

Done.

Done.
