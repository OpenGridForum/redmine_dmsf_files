Introduction - PC
-----------------

Goals

1. Requirements for data transport service specs from client point of view
2. Where should such services be developed
      New working group?

Data Transport - DAIS viewpoint - DP
------------------------------------

Data transport out of scope
Dependent on other groups to specify aspects of delivery
Deliver data from one source to one or more targets over various channels
>From small to very large data sets
Suppliers and consumers could be very closer or remote
      Geography
      Format
Transport may be deferred
En route data may be stored
Streaming and multi-casting are interesting
Monitoring and notification of transport process is interesting
Transport protocol independent
Systematic encryption and compression over selected channels
Data must be same at target as it was at source
Possibly composition of access and delivery mechanism
QOS
Control
      What is moved
      Where from/to
      Units of transfer - logical and physical

DM - in IETF this is application level
MA - to us its the pipe work
Dm - should the transport recognise the structure of the data
DP - we may want to say - "get the next record"

8 generic use cases have been documented in the working group which contain
delivery/distribution
Overall GDD meets many of the requirements that DAIS has identified

DM - If transformations used then this violates the "data is same at source
and target" requirement

MA - When handling large volumes of data important not to move it through
multiple stages. Need interface directly into transport mechanism without
copying bytes

DM - what about network part of transport.
      Latency
      Finding closest location
DP - Control over performance or cost of a movement is important.
MA - Want to be able to predict what we get with a particular transport
service
PC - EDG has Network Cost Function but not often used

DM - Accounting?
DP - Would like to track and make information available
DM - What granularity, bytes sent, records?
DP - Depends on what you are moving
PC - Service should have book keeping

Data Transport - GDD Viewpoint - SMi
------------------------------------

Want to support any open commodity data transport protocols.
Streaming is important

Fault tolerant and reliable.
      Fail over capability
      Redundancy
Connection pooling
      Low level requirement but important
Zero copy
      Support required at O/S level
Leverage existing underlying transport protocols
      Message oriented middleware

Presentation
Marshalling engine
      Don't want to invent a new one
Bundled execution
      Piggy back calls on top of existing calls
      Do as much as possible in one round trip
Data type and type evolution
      Good if transport handles user defined types. Mostly done at
application level though
NLS support and character set conversion
      Belongs in transport

Security
Open authentication protocols
Encryption, Non repudiations

QOS
Audit and tracking
      Don't necessarily want to do fine grained monitoring (bits/bytes). To
track and debug need it at a higher level

DM - what does recovery mean?
Recover the connection
Oracle has real application cluster. Shared DB architecture. Redundancy
through service name. Primary and secondary. If one goes down connection is
directed to the other.

PC - how does this overlap with GDD?
GDD has publication, subscription, propagation, consumption
Requirements discussed are all relevant to the propagation service

Data Transport - GFS Viewpoint - AJ
-----------------------------------

Grid File System
Virtual/logical namespace
Users consider it to be a single file system and do file IO
Actual files may be in file system, database
Files have meta data ACL, access times...
GFS is a layer over DAIS

Open, read, write, close...
want read/write ahead
striping and streaming of data
Caching and replication behind the scenes
Bulk operations
      Ship a collection of data with a single call
Third party delivery
Latency management

Similar requirements to DAIS
Additional bulk operations
Control over data movement process

MS - bulk operation lets you send header indicating much more data to come

PC - no explicit presentation from applications
     usually want simple interface
      source identifier
      destination identifier
     Management elsewhere is the correct approach

DM - say more about streaming

Skipping through data until we get to where we want to be

PC - not obvious that
      small time critical transport is the same as
      transport of large data sets

Data Transport Service - GHPN Viewpoint - FT
--------------------------------------------

Have bottom up view
Need top down view
Seen gap between business services and network

Data Transport Services...
Draft expected by GGF10 to chart the ecosystem

Requirements for DTS - philosophy

Requirements for DTS - basics
high level SLAs - one app knows about
low level SLAs - physical properties
FTP already supports 3rd party transfer

Requirements for DTS - help me to help you

Requirements for DTS - feedback

Requirements for DTS - scaling up

Requirements for DTS - hi-touch
scheduling
atomic data delivery - identify failover points?
anycasting - let network figure out the best source destination

A new draft
      By GGF10

PC - requesting network resource for a bypass is a good idea
     3.3.1 Data Transport Service overlaps with others
     E.g. we have a Data Transport research group that should be worrying
about some of this

We are worrying about the interface and about how the service can be
introspected

DM - people want network to be aware of structure of data (web proxies)
     Is DTS just about packets

Data awareness in transport is not a good idea
      Doesn't scale
      Security - data has to be in the clear at some point
      Better just to transfer the bits

DM - People in GGF are looking at application level data transport

Need to agree on level/scope of DTS

DM - may want to know that it is structured data that can be stored in an
intermediary
     views need to merged.

Data Transport - RFT Viewpoint - Not presented
----------------------------------------------

Understanding is that this overlaps with other areas but we don't know the
details
DM - real impact is the XIO which is new
NP - RFT is a services
      Request document
            list of files + source + destination
      Uses GridFTP to transfer
      Uses persistent state to record where it has got to
      Monitoring info also provided
      Not clear that they have addressed putting this on top of protocols
other than GridFTP

PC - Not clear if it is tied to GridFTP.
AC - It is dependent on GridFTP currently

Discussion
----------

PC - Should there be another Data Transport Group
      Clearly there could be
      Lot of work to research all points coming from top and bottom

DP - Need to partition and define interfaces at the overlap
      DAIS is at the top and wants to talk to GDD not transport
      GDD should then talk down to the next level
      Need model which defined boundaries and interface at those boudaries

PC - DAIS - application level
            Information distribution model tied to a subset of
applications?
      Is GDD specific to DAIS
      Agnostic transport level
      Network level

DP - Is the scope of GDD the whole spectrum or just replicas

FT - New category - Data Marshalling service
      Data transport service will be anonymous

MS - where does connection pooling live

FT - transport

MS - Connection pools are more effective if they are pushed up the stack
      Useful from a performance point of view to have info about data
resources

FT - client aware session layer

DM - Are there groups that can't live without a transport services

NP - problem is we don't know where to stop
      If we can't delegate we start to do it

DP - GDD is framed at the right level for us

PC - draws a picture

     ----------------------
     |  DAIS | OREP | GFS |
     ----------------------
     | GDD      | RFT     |
     ----------------------
     |  DTS               |
     ----------------------
     |  Network           |
     ----------------------

      Can't get mind round the nature of the middle two layers

MA - Looking for quality of delivery

DM - starting to look like content distribution/management networks. Most
gone out of business.
      Is there a critical mass of people who want to solve these problems

FT - can we have detailed use cases
      Food chain from client to service

DP - useful to take a use case and map it down through layers

FT - secondary goal is to see if we are over engineering

PC - But this is a lot of work
      A group focused on architecture for information distribution would
seem like a good idea
      Might lead to requirements for services at different layers

DP - DAIS has a good working relationship with GDD

MA - Isn't this in scope of the gap analysis

DM - Is any of this in scope of Data Area
      GGF is a good place to do this IETF/W3C both seem inappropriate

PC - So we would like it to be done but who is going to do it
      How do we make the individuals working on this work together?
      Inappropriate to release a spec out of one are that misses most of
the clients

FT - Mike Back? (Logistical Network) may want to contribute

OT - What is the relative position of data access interfaces w.r.t the
access that the likes of RFT do

PC - Data Access interfaces should be talked to by transport but in
practice this doesn't work

AJ - Connection management/pooling is critical to GFS also

DM - no group is currently looking at content transport layer

PC - Suggestion
      DAIS produces an information document on GDD
      All others with interest should contribute
      Layer picture would be instructive

DM - could be that in future that a GDD group is formed

SL - GDD is not just about databases

PC - what is the scope of GDD

MS - Next FTF
      Rules aspects
      Expressions and transformations
      Transport
            Interesting interplay as well as with data access
      Informational paper is a good idea

DM - is GDD a general solution or focused on DAIS/Database

MS - GDD is based on information sharing
      Theoretically GDD could be done independently of databases

DM - Do people want to make it more general or more specific

NP - Inderpal thinking more broadly than databases

NP - Need a positioning/related work section in the GDD document
      Does this replace the requirement for a separate document?

DP - if there is someone who wants to write another document we are happy
for it go through DAIS

MA - Data Area meeting will have web site and call. Could be place to
collect know gaps and we may find someone to work on it
