o OGF21

Neither Mario and Dave will be able to attend OGF21.
Said and Isao will be there.
it appears that Miguel will be there as well.
A DAIS session has been booked.
There has not been much contact between Spain and Japan.

Progress at AIST - most completed the specification.
Have downloaded the new version of documents at the end of August.
Have produced a summarised version of the scenarios document.
No new issues have been found since the last OGF meeting.

AIST waiting to see if they can get a common ontology with the Spanish
group or whether to proceed by themselves.

Dave attended a semantic tech conference in Vienna at the beginning of
June and talked about the group and has talked to other people -
difficult to get people involved.

Have an early implementation based on OGSA-DAI but do not have many
users as yet.

Would be important to get the Spanish and the AIST version of the
documents consistent.

Dave will email Miguel to tell him that the AIST work is almost complete
and it is important for the two pieces of work are consistent and ask 
him if he's going to OGF21 (found out from MSN later that Miguel would be
at OGF21).

AIST want to publish their work as early as possible, possibly February
next year. The final decision will be made based on what the Spanish
group.

Dave's Oracle work has changed and has not had enough time to provide
the necessary leadership. Dave feels he needs to step down from the
chair position.

Mario is willing to step up but not acting as the single chair. 

Isao is also willing to act as chair for this session.

Dave Pearson will email the group to state that he will be stepping
down as chair and see if anyone is willing to step-up.

There will be another call after OGF to finalise these details.
