---

Query and Ontology documents stalled until motivational document is
done.

Steven has added the motivational text as modified by Mario to
the motivational document.

Miguel wants to modify the last paragraph of the motivational text
sent out by Steven to include something related to the update
facilities not present in SPARQL and will send to Steven.

Motivational document has been changed a bit by Steven and Isao. 
Needs some work from Miguel - some comments need to be resolved.
Mario should have a look at some point too.

Mario brought the question as to who the document is directed at.
Have two use cases that are Grid orientated: Grid resource monitoring 
and Grid match making and discovery.

Mario thought that it should address the RDF community to try to
entice them into the fold.

Miguel thinks it's the other way round - it should motivate the Grid
community to use RDF - too much complexity for the RDF community at
the moment - they are happy with what they have. To entice them in we
really need more than just a specification - an implementation with
the specification to show them the added value of this work would be
better. Early attempts to entice the RDF community have not been 
successful.

The motivational document will be read OGF people - the focus is more
on Grid people. The main target audience is thus the Grid community.

Have one use case that would appeal to the RDF community. Can try to
get more use cases once we publicise the document.

Carlos will provide a use case based on the ADMIRE community.

Process:

1. Steven puts the motivational document up on GridForge.
2. Miguel will make modifications once this is up.
3. 
   (i)  MAA will go through the document once Miguel is done.
   (ii) Try to get ADMIRE use case from Carlos
4. Review the document at the next telcon.
5. Distribute the document for other people to comment and
   contribute use cases.
6. Try to submit the document in mid or late August.
