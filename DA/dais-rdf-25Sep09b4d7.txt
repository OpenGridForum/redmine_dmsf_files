===================================

Attendees:

   - Planning

---

Mario has still got some concerns about the ontology part of the
motivational document and submitting the document as is might set 
these in stone. His main issues are:

- Use of terminology: some of it is a bit unwieldy 
- The sheer number of operations and their scope. Some of them are
  doing management of the underlying resource which would be out
  of scope for DAIS. This may also have an impact on the number of
  implementations that may arise.
- This has an impact in the effort that is going to have to be 
   used for interop testing.

It may well be that things have changed since he last read the
document properly so he would like to give the document another read
and think about the implications.

Steven thinks that more examples should be given of what sort of
activities would be enabled by each of the profiles. It would be good
if these could be cross referenced to the use cases. Oscar said
that he and Miguel will try to come up with these.

Discussion Fig 5 and 6 are a bit too complex and contain too much
detail. May want to revise.

The possible impact that would happen if the W3C SPARQL update group
were to come up with a W3C spec - the query spec could support it by
adding a new supported language URI, the ontology spec would offer
a complementary way of doing updates.

Addressed one comment - removed the GRIMOIRES reference for the
document.

Plan:

Mario will try to read through the document hopefully over the weekend
and put something up by Monday.
In the meantime Oscar/Miguel can supply examples of the functionality
each profile would enable and send to the list/add to the document if
they have the document write token.
Miguel/Oscar get the write token Mon-Wed (if Mario has done his bit by
then).
Steven picks up the write token Thursday & Friday.
Have another telcon on October the 5th at 8am UK time to discuss
whether the document is in a state to submit to the OGF Editor.
Once the motivational document has gone through the 30 day comment 
period the Query spec can go through the review OGF review process 
if there are no major issues with the motivational document.
