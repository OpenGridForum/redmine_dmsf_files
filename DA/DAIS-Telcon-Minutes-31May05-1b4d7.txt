Agenda:

 o Specification things.

Actions:

[Mario] Find out what practice is used for versioning GGF documents.

+--

Timetable is to have WS-DAI/WS-DAIR WSDL ready by 3rd June
		     WS-DAI ready by 8th June
		     WS-DAIR/WS-DAIX spec and WSDL ready by 10th June
		     All specs including WSDL ready by 17th of June

Try to get specs into a shape close to recommendation level for GGF.

Core spec slightly ahead of schedule. Have first versions of the WSDL.

Should operate on the assumption that Simon is away this week.

Amy is to look at the WSDL for the XML spec but will not have much
time this week.

Not many issues of the specs on Grid Forge but a lot of comments in
the spec. Mario did not want to bring up anything at this moment in
time.

Mario iterating spec with Susan.

For now should not put an explicit version number on the documents but
consider putting this for submission. Try to follow any established
GGF practice -- see what other people have done. Mario takes an action
on this.
