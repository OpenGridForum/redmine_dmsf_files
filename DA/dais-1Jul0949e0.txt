Isao, who would be unable to attend the meeting, noted by email:

1) Carlos should add the ADMIRE use case to the motivational
   document. The rough deadline will be end of July (I hope).

2) Contact Beniamino Di Martino, who contacted us just after Catania OGF,  
   to contribute (a) use case(s) to the motivational document.

Isao uploaded a new version (typos fixed in the WSDL). I hope it is
almost stable.

Carlos is currently working on adding RDF capabilities to OGSA-DAI for
the ADMIRE project.  He hopes to have this done by some point in
July. After that he would be able to write a use case for the
Motivational document.

Not clear at the moment whether use cases from Beniamino Di Martino
would require use of Grid technology. From the papers he sent out it
appears that his work is more to do with the creation of RDF. It
is not exploiting information and his focus is on algorithms. Semantic
orientated and not using the data approaches. It may still be worth
trying to get feedback from him about the motivational cases and if
relevant for him provide use cases.

Oscar has released an internal version of the motivational
document. Would like to get feedback for this document from Isao and
Steven. Need to provide a greater rationale for this work - also to
have a clearer road map in the document. Once this is added have a
discussion on any outstanding issues in the document. After this make
the document public and try to get more feedback.

Steven is nominally in agreement with Oscar. The document write token
goes to AIST for now.

Miguel has put up the WSDL/XSD for all the profiles. He will be doing
a bit of refactoring to do this.

Plan:
     Steven and Isao will comment on Oscar's comment on the motivational
     document and add any further content.
     Steven will start the motivational content discussion outside 
     the document, i.e. by email. 
     Have a discussion in 2 weeks time at the next call and hopefully put the
     document on to a public forum.
     Try to get feedback and new use cases.
     Carlos can add the ADMIRE use case in the document
     Submit to the OGF editor at some near future point.

DONM 8am UK time (GMT + 1), 16th July.
