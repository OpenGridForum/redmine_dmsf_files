The group discussed progress with WS-DAI/WS-DAIR.

There is concern that the review is taking a long time. The feeling is that we should go ahead and update the RDF querying specification to reflect the WS-DAI/WS-DAIR changes now instead of waiting any longer.

Pressing ahead with the RDF work is also important as Carlos needs to wrap up his work on this by 20th July.

Carlos gave an overview of the current status of his implementation. Everything is going well, the service interfaces have been created without any problems using the latest WSDL and deployed using a Glassfish server. He'll use Jena to provide the RDF DB.

AIST can still do interoperability testing after the 20th July as long as the UPM implementation is working. Steven will update the RDF spec, then Carlos and Steven will start an interoperability testing document and get as far as they can.

Interoperability testing will be completed at AIST as 20th July is too ambitious a time-frame for this.

Following on from recent messages on the mailing list, DatasetTooLargeFault was discussed. Consensus was reached and the we decided to go back to the previous proposal of just having the fault for direct access operations when the dataset is too large for direct access only, thereby suggesting the use of indirect access to the client. Having the fault thrown for factory operations seems to go out-of-scope and its not exactly clear under which circumstances it should be generated.
