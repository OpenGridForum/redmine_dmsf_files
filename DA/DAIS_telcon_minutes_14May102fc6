Mario has completed almost all the changes to WS-DAI/WS-DAIR that were
recommended as a result of interoperability testing.

The group went through some outstanding issues:

- WS-DAI change #11: DatasetTooLargeFault - some doubt about whether
it should apply to factory operations but consensus is that it should.

- WS-DAI change #31: Make DatasetData optional (e.g. for queries that
don't return datasets such as SQL stored procedures) - some doubt
about whether we should do this or recommended returning empty
datasets. Consensus is to make it optional.

- WS-Addressing issue: the version of WS-Addressing used by WS-DAI was
updated to a different one than that used by the WSRF data resource,
we should revert back to make this consistent.

Mike will do a final check of the changes. After that we can ask for
input from the mailing list and make a final call. We need to find out
about the status of the WS-DAI/WS-DAIR review and move towards a final
submission which will then allow the RDF querying specification to
move forward.

Oscar suggests that putting up a list of people using the WS-DAI
family of specifications would be a good idea.

Oscar reports on the status of the RDF work at UPM.

- He is trying to find someone to take over from Miguel and work on
the Ontology spec and will make a decision about what to do about this
by the next OGF.

Planning and working out the timelines regarding the RDF work is very
important.

- Carlos has almost completed his implementation of the RDF Querying
specification. This will be used to do interoperability testing with
the implementation developed at AIST.

None of the attendees have definite plans to attend OGF 29. The next
DAIS-WG session will probably be at OGF 30 in Brussels.

Planning
--------

There will be no DAIS session at OGF 29.

Next call on 7th June at 7am GMT.
