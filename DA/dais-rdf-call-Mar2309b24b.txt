DAIS RDF Call - 24 March 2009
=============================

Present:
	Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
	Isao Kojima, AIST
        Steven Lynden, AIST

Agenda:

- Progress, status of:
   - motivational/glossary/scenarios document
   - query document
   - ontology document
- Planning

---

No presence from UPM so could not coordinate.

The plan is to merge the currently separate motivation, use cases and
glossary documents into one document and submit this as an
informational document to OGF. This would allow UPM (ontologies) and
AIST (querying) to decouple the work and potentially submit their
documents separately. Isao has started working on this.

Mario had a brief look at the Ontology spec which roughly about 87
operations compared to the querying spec's 12 (rough numbers). This
is a bit of a concern.

After 10 minutes called the call to a close as a UPM presence was
required. Will try to carry the discussion by email instead.
