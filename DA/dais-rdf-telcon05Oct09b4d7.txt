Agenda:

    - Motivational document
    - OGF 27
    - Planning

---

[SL] Change query spec to use GraphCollection as opposed RDFSCollection.

[IK] Decides on the authoring order for this document if not 
     constrained to use alphabetical ordering.
--

Walked through the outstanding comments in the document and
resolved them. 

Isao is to be the corresponding author.

Steve will check whether there is a required author ordering, if not
then Isao will decide on what the author ordering should be.

Steve will check on the consistency in the authors in the references
and move reference URLs to be in-lined in the main text as opposed
to it being in the references section.

Steven will make changes to the document and upload (or pass on to
Mario to upload if there are still issues accessing Grid Forge in
Japan). Steven issue a last call for comments to the group to comment
by Friday.

It will be submitted by Isao on Friday or Mario if there are still
issues accessing Grid Forge in Japan.

- OGF27

Discussed ideas of what to present.

Miguel will send Steven slides for the ontology work if these are not
on Grid Forge (or if it cannot be accessed).
 
Session is on Monday morning first thing which is probably not the
best time to get attendees. Isao came up with a plan for the
presentation:

 - Isao will give a status update for the group
 - Steven will report on the Interop process
 - Isao will talk about th motivational document
 - General Discussion

Discussion as to whether an overview should be given if someone
asked for it - Mario thought it might be best to bundle that in
the status update for the group.

- Planning

The interop document is out there for public comment so it would
be good if people could comment on it, e.g. Isao, Miguel, Oscar ...

Hope to have the motivational document go to the OGF Editor this
Friday and go into public comment soon after that.

Once interop document comes back will need to make changes on to
the WS-DAI core document and the WS-DAIR document - not sure what
the process for this is.

Once the motivational document is back from public comment, assuming
no major problems with it, submit the query spec for public comment.

Begin the interop process for the query spec once the query spec 
goes into public comment. Write experimental document and put this
into public comment.

Need to progress the ontology spec in the meantime.

Sounds like a plan for now.

No call scheduled in advance for now. Will determine when the
next call should take place via email.
