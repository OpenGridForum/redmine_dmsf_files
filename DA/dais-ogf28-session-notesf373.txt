Mario introduces the session, full spec introduction omitted because
everyone is from the WG.
- Background of the group explained.
- WS-DAIO dead and files out of scope
- We have three proposed realisations
- We have an interoperability testing document
- We have done interoperability with WS-DAI and WS-DAIR
- The RDF ontology and querying specifications are in preparation
- 17 WS-DAI and 32 WS-DAIR changes have been recommended as a result
of interoperability process.
- Waiting for Neil Chue Hong to review the interoperability testing report.
- The published PDF spec documents is not the same as the latest
gridforge version. Need the MS-Word source.
- WS-DAI and WS-DAIR specs changes need to be checked by multiple parties.
- Mario will step down as chair, Oscar Corcho willing to step up
(subject to group agreement)
- WS-DAI-RDF query spec will undergo interoperability testing between
AIST and UPM.
- A question mark about WS-DAIX as there is only one implementation.
Carlos says the ontology spec will continue.

Isao Kojima presents WS-DAI-RDF
- Progress since OGF 27
 - Motivational doc containing use cases and agreed terms published
 - Journal paper has also been published
- Use-cases described
- Background described
- Demo some RDF querying implementation presented
Mario and Carlos discuss whether there are too many operations in the
RDF ontology specification.
Carlos says that some of them can be optional.

The group agrees the following process:
- Get the review from Neil.
- Make the changes to WS-DAI and WS-DAIR, with some double-checking to
filter out any typos.
- Take the RDF querying specification through interoperability testing.
- Determine what will happen with the ontology specification.

- Erwin points out that after this the group has the following
options: could go dormant, can break-up, can turn into a community
group - talking to people implementing the specs.
- The aim for the next OGF is to have completed WS-DAI and WS-DAIX and
have started the RDF query interoperability testing
- Erwin points out that a WS-DAIS implementation was presented as the
Grid Interoperability Now session (D-Grid Monitoring Interface)
