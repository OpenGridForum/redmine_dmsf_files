---        

o Oscar Corcho to become new DAIS chair

  No objection so Oscar is to become the new DAIS chair.

o Steven Lynden to become new DAIS secretary

  No objection so Steven is the new DAIS secretary.

o Feedback from OGF

  The session was a bit disappointing because no new people turned up
  to the meeting. Should try to get new people on board or move to
  finishing the work as quickly as possible and closing the
  group. Managed to do some DAIS planning at OGF though.

o Progress with GFD.74 and GFD.76 updates

  MAA has started making the modifications to GFD.74. Still have to do
  points 5, 11, 12 and 13 from GFD.160. Not started looking at GFD.76
  yet. Poking the reviewer to complete his review for OGF.

  Hope to finish GFD.74 by the end of the week and complete GFD.76 by
  next week. Steven and Mike to sanity check changes after that.

o Future Plans

Plan:
  - Once GFD.74 is through complete the Query spec.
  - Put the query spec on to public comment.
  - Get AIST and UPM implementations to do interop.
  - Write experimental document to take the query spec to full
    recommendation status.

  UPM want to evaluate the zeroth profile for the ontology part
  of the RDF work. If it's worth going on with then the group 
  will try to quickly complete the spec. AIST willing to do an
  implementation as long as the work can be completed by March
  2011.

o AOB

Skype call did not work too well this time round but unless
someone suggests an alternative the next call will be a Skype
one on the 20th April 7am GMT. Isao/Oscar will chair and Steven
will take minutes.
