       - query document
       - ontology documents
- Planning

Actions
-------

[SL] Get a list of the most recent changes that have been made to the
     RDF query specification by the AIST implementor. Publicise any
     changes that have been made (tracker/mailing list).


[MEG] Get Carlos (ADMIRE developer) to join the DAIS mailing list and
      encourage him to participate in the spec process.

[SL]  Create a set of subdirectories in the SVN repository for 
      the RDF ontology and query wsdl/xsd.

[MAA] Move the old ontology document into the old documents folder.

[MEG] Put the WSDL/XSD for the RDF(S) spec on SVN on Grid Forge.

Completed Actions
-----------------

[MAA] Read and comment back on the RDF(S) document.

      Did this but for the document before it was split but the
      comments are still valid.

[MEG] Report back on who from UPM could do an implementation of the
      query document and on what time lines.

      Carlos from the ADMIRE project will be doing this.
      He is currently doing the implementation.
      It is important that he openly comments on his findings. It
      would be good if he could join telcons.

[MEG] Talk to the ADMIRE developer who is using the WSDL/XSD from the
      query spec and report back if there are any issues.

      Done.

      on SVN on GridForge.

- Progress, status of: DAIS RDF motivational document

Most of last week was a holiday in Japan.
Nothing to report.

- Progress, status of: query document

Some comments have been made on the mailing list from ADMIRE
implementing the query spec - mainly typos.

- Progress, status of: ontology documents

Mario commented on part of the ontology document - picked the entire
document as opposed to the inner profile. Passed these on to
Miguel. Miguel will have a look and produce an updated version of the
document.

- Planning

No OGF sessions. 
Next call on 21 May 2009.
