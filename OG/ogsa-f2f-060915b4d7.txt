* General session

** Document schedule review

  - Reviewed document schedule and revised completion dates. The
    revised dates are recorded in the slides and uploaded to
    gridforge.
  - Postponed decision on content and title of the new EMS
    capabilities 'scenario' document. Dates for this document are not
    clear either. (Needs more discussion.)
  - EMS Architecture document postponed again in favor of additional
    'scenarios' document
  - Discussed how many documents the Information Modeling design team
    is producing and their expected content. Modified titles to
    capture intent---they are not EMS specific.
      1. How to go about adding definitions (process)
      2. Container information model
      2. Information modeling in OGSA

    - Need schema definitions. 
    - It would also be nice to have additional (human readable)
      definitions and mapping online. These could be in a wiki with
      additional links to schemas etc. In this case proper access
      control and versioning is needed.

** Teleconference schedule

   Discussed times after the change from summer time to standard time
   at the end of October. Agreed to change the start times to avoid
   calls going past midnight in UK (Monday) and Japan (Thursday).

   - Monday:   7am-9am JST / 10pm-midnight UK
   - Thursday: 10pm-midnight JST / 7am-9am CT

** DMTF Work Register review

   Reviewed current work register text. Many of the items are probably
   already finished but confirmation is needed.

   AI-0915a: Ellen to check the status of the items on the
             DMTF work register: report which have been done, and what
             DMTF is doing for the rest.

   AI-0915b: Ellen to propose new text to update the DMTF register

* BaseFaults discussion

  A number of issues had been raised in the BES discussion. Some
  relating to the BaseFaults specification, their use in BES, and the
  statements in the WSRF BP.
  
  - After review of the BaseFaults issues it was agreed that there is
    nothing broken in the BaseFaults specification.
  - There is an errata issue with the WSRF BP

  AI-0915c: Tom will post BP base faults issue to tracker

  AI-0915d: Hiro to talk with OGF Editor to start an errata process

  - It was agreed that the BaseFaults does not affect BES negatively
 
  - The use of BaseFaults and WS-Naming was discussed with no
    conclusion.
