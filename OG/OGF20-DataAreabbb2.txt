David,

Unfortunately this clashes with another session I need to attend.

Because of travel restrictions we will not be having sessions this
time - however there will definitely be INFOD sessions at OGF21

However progress has been very good. We have submitted a revised
specification (today). It took a lot of work and long discussions to
get it finalised.

We continue to have a phone call each week to drive the work forward.

The main non-commercial implementation project with much of the effort
from the University of Texas, Knoxville is moving forward well. Phone
meetings are held on Mondays and there is a Wiki at
http://panda.ece.utk.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/INFODutk. The
implementation will be open-source with a phased implementation
plan. Currently work is going on creating the key components and
interfaces as web-services. The work is initially being layered on top
of existing commercial systems.

So everything is going to plan.

We also see that a document has been submitted on the experimental
track by E Huh "via INFOD-WG". This came as something of a surprise
though we were aware that some work was going on.

Steve
