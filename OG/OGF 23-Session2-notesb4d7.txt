Minutes for the Network Modelling Language WG session #2 (2008-06-03)

Paola Grosso introduces the Agenda. 

Then, Victor Reijs (HEAnet) presented "Domains in and around the Stitching Framework" via VC. After that there was a discussion about naming of domain classes.
- Ingress and egress are not fully defined, but from signal level, ingress is closest to user A, while egress is closest to user B. In the special case that the linking domain is composed of source and destination, it has both, ingress and egress.

- the user domain is outside of signaling and the home domain is the proxy to the signaling domain. The name "user domain" is confusing, as it can be a single IP or a network.

- discussion about the comparison between names in the stitching framework and IDC.

- overlapping in domains: network elements can be part of multiple domains. One domain can have more than one role. A generic domain can map to source, destination, or a combination. Hierarchy in domains, difficult, see iterative aggregation domains, e.g. 

- from a security point of view there are different domains: administrative, security, and security federation. No similarity between aggregation and federate domain, but may overlap.

After that Martin Swany is presenting the existing definitions of network elements, which are discussed. Progress is made with some definitions and recorded by Martin. Due to time contraints the discussion is suspended to a later, informal session in a smaller group.
