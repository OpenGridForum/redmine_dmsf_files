Action:

Context:

Steven written document changes, with comments from others

[Changes in document]

Identified requirement for management of credentials in relation to
particular file transfers (note for basic FTP, can encode in URL)

Identified requirement to do credential stuff as a separate item

Identified probable requirement to couple DMI to some kind of replica
catalog service or registry (or RNS or ...)

Need to work on combining JSDL and DMI DEPRs
