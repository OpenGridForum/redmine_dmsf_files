* Roadmap review

  - Should the Reference Model be added to the Roadmap document?
    - Agreed that it should. It is not an OGSA document but it is
      relevant and the Roadmap is not just for OGSA produced documents
    - At the moment there are two documents but these will end up as a
      single normative document
    - The 'Reconciliation' document is a separate (third)
      informational document and another entry will have to be added
    - Hiro created a tracker for these documents and assigned it to
      Chris J who will contact Paul S and Dave S and get this information

  - Information model documents? Still three documents.

  AI-0625a: Hiro will check number and status of the info model
