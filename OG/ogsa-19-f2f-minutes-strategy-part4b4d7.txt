* Introduction

- Steven explains overview of our past-day discussion to Laurence 
  using his slides.

- Steven asks "Do we jump on the Cloud?"
- Laurence: people has difference view on what they want. He sees 
  Grid is service oriented. He is not sure the difference between 
  Web Services interface vs. Grid interface. Grid interface should 
  be something like USB. Cloud should be backplane for the Grid. 
  People want to build cloud needs low level API, e.g. monitoring 
  and security.
- Existing typical clouds are propriety but still need a standards 
  for scale /uniformity.
- One of the purpose of cloud is scalability. Thus cloud needs common
  interface.

- Amazon provides interface to their cloud.
- Standardization of such interface is beneficial to end user but
  Amazon does not come to us to standards it.
- Current Amazon interface lacks a lot of features, including security,
  managability, service discovery.

* What is different Cloud computing and Grid computing.

- Cloud computing is nothing new.
- Grid computing comes from HPC computing.
- Cloud computing comes from distributing computing people.
- Cloud computing is just set of services and each service is provided
  by provider. On the other hand, Grid computing is set of services and 
  all work togother to make sence.

- Andrew: Cloud is giant step back. send difficult problems back to
  each providers.

- User does not need to worry any of these problems that is good for 
  user.
- All these issues should be taken care by the provider and provider
  may/should use grid technologies/specifications. they can be OGF spec
  consumer.
- E.g. Utility Model: Payment & account

- Amazon knocks out Sun mainly by price.
- Amazon uses virtualizaiton. but it has its own limitation including
  RDB.
- Amazon did not make money in 2007.
- Jury is still out
- If we have enough local storage, we don't need S3 except backup

* Formal possible proposals for OGSA strategy
- Reduce the interim meetings between OGFs
  -- Continue telecon schedule
- Continue meeting at regular OGF events
- Focus implementation of existing/emerging specs
  -- Socialize adoption

* New Activity: The Access Layer
- Scenario driven focus for accessing the Grid
  -- real small incremental scenarios (c.f. EMS)
- Incremental scenario led API development
  -- Reflect port-type into an API using tooling
  -- Wrap web service through RESTian/CRUD model
  -- Examine role of SAGA in this space

* Community Group around a scenario
  - Bring specific vendors, software providers & vendors for a 
    specific activity
  - Make it a very specific, finite scope.
  - We will go to OGF22 cloud BoF session.
