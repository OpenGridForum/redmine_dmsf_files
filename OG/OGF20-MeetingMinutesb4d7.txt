Security aspects need to be considered; e.g. trust level between systems
  Ongoing project at University of Amsterdam
  Willing to participate in the WG on this topic

How to make progress with this WG?
  Lots of overlap with other WGs and organisations
  Objective of WG is too huge to begin with
  Suggestion: Define small starting point to begin with

Overlap to CIM activities (SVPC group)
  Find out what part of the model is needed w.r.t. grid
  Find out what is missing

Cooperation with EGA reference model WG 
  Already started
