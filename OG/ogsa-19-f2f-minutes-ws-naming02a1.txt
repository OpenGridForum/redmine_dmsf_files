No outstanding Actions.

| * Adoption of WS-Naming.

The spec had a bit to allow the address to hold the EPI. There may be
some problem with the client knowing the location of thi
identifier. There is a separate claim URI for this, so what is the
problem?

[-] ISSUE: Should WS-Naming take action on the EPI in the address.

No action required.

No action to be taken however.

The Resolver is the key function that UvA has exploited. It is thought
that Frank is doing something with this spec, but we have not
confirmed this. Fujitsu plans to use it in USMT. It seems that DIAS
working group may use this.

[Andrew] ACTION: Andrew to contact Satoshi Sekiguchi to see if
WS-Naming can be incorporated into DIAS WG.

They don't use it now, but might think about it in future work.

Uptake in industry is dependent on a product or use case
requirement. The fact is that within the enterprise today most
relocation is done with V-LANS and load balancers. So only when
distribution is required across multiple institutions is WS-Naming
needed.

Groups like EGEE might be possible targets.

There is a possible enhancement to allow the client to indicate in
requests the service that it understands the WS-Naming protocol. The
problem is this. If the service can satisfy the request, but would
rather redirect further requests. If the service can't tell the client
understands, the service cannot redirect.

[-] ISSUE: What do we do about a client indicating that it understands
WS-Naming?

[Andrew] ACTION: Find out from Mark how this is supported in Genesis.

If we do an errata:

- Add client capability hint.
- Tidy up EPI Address profile (wrt rebinding).
- Add Frank to the editors list.

[Andrew and Dave] ACTION: Decide on errata plans.
