* Last teleconf minutes approval: postponed to next call.

* Agenda bashing

  - Need more time to generate text than reviewing
    - Also a (perhaps) longer cross review section
  - Broader question of whether we think we are ready for final draft
    and how to go about it.
    - Decided on second agenda bashing tomorrow morning
    - Decided to split into teams in the afternoon

  - Possible connection/overlap with DMTF Utility Computing WG
    - Working on taxonomy that is a bit different than us
    - No Utility Computing F2F at GGF11 but many of the group's
      members  are coming to GGF
    - Jeffrin would like to have some time there to discuss
      relationship.
      - Hiro to allocate one of the design team sessions at GGF11 for
        this.

* OGSA diagram (marketing)

  - Background to creation
    - Need one slide to present to sponsors etc (marketing); for use
      by GMAC etc
    - Make no technical points wrt design; does not have to be the
      same as the 'real' taxonomy in the doc.
    - Identity (the image when thinking of OGSA)
    - This is a 'what' chart
    - We also need a 'why' chart and so on.
  - Comments on formatting
    - Text should not go outside the circles
    - (similarity with GGF logo?)
    - Services in big circles and the other circles are capabilities
      of those services (and remove 'service' word from the little circles)
  - Comments on content
    - Not Status & Monitoring -> Information and Monitoring
      - Information Services -> Discovery
      - Add Status or Monitoring (small circle)
  - Missing things
    - Availability or Autonomic category is not in the picture
      - Autonomic is everywhere; no need to have a specific entry
        (circle)
      - Availability (management): Appears also as a facet or aspect in
        other components. But it is one of the things people typically
        expect to see.
        - Include it as a separate category
    - Data replication
  - Do we think this picture stays fixed forever?
    - No, it will change over time and we'll have to update it.

* OGSA document structure review

  - Information or recommendation?
    - Lacks the detail of a recommendation 
    - Guideline to people writing specifications (so in that sense it
      seems to fall into recommendation)
      - Problem: How to come up with 2 implementations to actually
        move it through the recommendation process; tricky
    - Also it depends on specifications not yet standard
    - GGF Information track explanation mentions 'architecture'
    - Concern with Information track and lack of rigorous process to
      its acceptance (in comparison with recommendation)

  - Agreed to 
    - Information track for first submission (if we can get it done for
      GGF11)
    - Recommendation track for final submission (at a later stage)
    - (Somewhat unconventional approach but possible.)

  - Need to publish something solid for GGF11. Possibilities:
    1. Good draft identifying areas that might change (possibly
       deleting stuff that is not ready)
    2. An 'outline' (high level architectural document) together with
       other documents that go in more detail (produced later on).
    3. A somewhat extended version of requirements and use case
       analysis, and capabilities (as initial submission)
    4. A higher-level unified draft covering some key capabilities or
       themes, e.g., PE, VO. And pointing out areas that need more
       work.

    - What our consumers want vs what we want (for GGF11)
      - section 5 (a factoring of services)
        1. Single paragraph for each service
        2. Do just a couple in detail 

    - And the relation of GGF11 draft and the longer term
      specification

    - Produce a strawman of what we have (incl. revised chapter 4) and
      rethink. 

  - Identify architecture principles (andrew to do a draft) >Done
    - Consider how to fit it in the document.
  
( - What are the expectations we have to satisfy by releasing a
    document and how long do we have to put it together.
    - Timeliness to influence other groups (incl. companies)
    - and/versus having something solid enough that will be useful )

  - If part of ogsa mission is to coordinate other WG work we have to
    spend more time working with other groups.
    - In particular work in chapter 5 is not always directly connected
      to other WGs. Use stuff in chapter 5 as input/proposal to
      related WGs (together with overall framework) and use their
      output as final content of ch5.
    - Often such WGs do not exist
    - And do we have the overall framework set up already? (For
      scoping etc) 
  
* Document (chapter 4) review

  - OGSA Capabilities   
    - Execution Services                - Andrew: Ravi, Jeffrin,
                                          Jay, Chris, Andreas
    - Data Services                     - DaveB: Andrew, Dave, (Andreas)
    - Resource Management Services      - Fred: Latha, Jay, Kojo
    - Security Services                 - skip; only one security
                                          expert attending
    - ?Self-Management? Services        - Jeff, Jeffrin, Andreas, Hiro, Jay
      - (service level attainment)
    - ?Information? Services            - Abdeslem, Hiro 
    - Context Services                  -  ?
    - Infrastructure Services           - Ian 

  (-For feedback to marketing picture too)

  - Service level attainment 
    - Different level than chapter 4 or not (cross cutting)
    - contained in ?Self-Management?

  - ?Analytic? services
    - Not sure where this fits (possibly contained somewhere else)
    - Leave out for now

* Requirements review

  - Read and comment session. 
  - General agreement that this rewrite is an improvement on the
    previous text.
  - Detailed comments by person (with apologies for any incorrect
    attributions) 
    
    <Jeffrin>
        Should also cover:
        - Network services
        - High level services
        - Service Composition
        - Policy Management
    
    <DaveB>
        Requirements for
        - protocols and schemas
        - resource description and job description
        - naming
        - access control
        - Check point & Migration
    
        Also
        - Move "resource utilization" section after "job"
        - Better separate out "QoS assurance"
        
    <DaveS>
        - Need reqs for "service level attainment"
    
    <Fred>
        Requirements for
        - Intrusion detection
    
        Also 
        - scalable computing section is too e-Science based, add
          commercial considerations
        - discovery vs query: difference is not clear
    
    <Andrew>
        - Usage of *must* may have to be toned down (and/or be made
          clearer that these are OGSA requirements not Grid ones)
        - Data catalog shouldn't be just data (naming)
        - VO refinement is needed (and relation with other requirements; seems
          at different level.)
          - It looks more like a solution of other requirements
        - (Site) autonomy and whether it can/should be delegated
          - (and level of requirement)
        - Extensibility
        - Ease of Use
    
        (Andrew also sent a more extensive list of comments to the list.)
    
    <Jeff>
        - Business utility model requirements
        - Lifecycle of HE; why is this different enough to be called out.
        - Requirements on composition, workflow (only description)
        - Need requirement for
          - monitoring
          - minimizing delegation
    
    <Kojo>
        - VO mgmt 
        - Mixture between functionality and requirements (projected view)
    
    <Takuya>
        - Discovery vs query: not clear what is different
    
    <Jay>
        - Security: minimize risk of misuse rather than misuse
        - Use case references; how meaningful are they. Consider removing completely.
        - Separate QoS into separate topic; not just as part of Job/Data
        - Firewall (traversal) is too specific; talk about 'organizational
          boundaries' or 'domains'
        - Problem determination in 2.7 seems misplaced
        - Meta-scheduling; what it means, it is not only for eScience
     
    <Abdeslem>
        - "dynamic" aspect
        - Performance aspects
        - is this a Complete list? And is this the right factoring?
    
    <Ian>
        - "Job" section needs more refinement
    
    <Latha>
        - Enable applications to support heterogeneity
        - Robustness of VO
    
    <Ravi>
        - Separate "functions" and "management functions"
        - Let application user drive grid system
        - Draw the line between "QoS (provided by resources)" and "SLA"
        - Most of them are functional requirements, we also need 
          non-functional requirements
        - Need infrastructure requirements
        - Since 2.7 "resource management" is more important, move it ahead
        - Add "protection" requirement to security section.
        - 2.8 & 2.9 covers SLA, let's contrast them to supply side QoS.
        - More emphasis on adaptivity and dynamicity
    

* <<Split into sub-teams --- results in Sub-team reports section>>

* Agenda Bashing

** Sub-team reports

  - OGSA Capabilities   
    - Execution Services
                Has 'detailed' text; agreed refactoring/simplification
                outline, to make up to (or rather down to) 3-5 pages
                         abstract (meta) figure
                         not just "run job" but more general use case
    - Data Services                     
                No text yet.
                Produced Outline. Expect to make 3-5+ pages
                         Models
                         Functional capabilities
                         Properties
                         Requirements on rest of OGSA

    - Resource Management Services
               - Text available

               - Have a set of requirements to add to chapter 2
               (Action: Fred to send requirements to Andreas/Hiro)

        (- Requirements on resources vs requirements on the managers of
           the resources
         - Need more work to define higher services (PE, Data, etc) to
           get a clearer image of what's needed further down
           (resources)
         - Connection to WSDM and what is needed to fit in OGSA (gap)
        )


    - Security Services                 
      - Skip 
        
    - ?Self-Management? Services        
      - (Service level attainment, provisioning, etc)
        - Some high level text
        - To fold together with other text on SLAL and Provisioning
        - Call planned for May 13.

    - ?Information? Services            
      - Working out outline/text
      - Need definition of event, information, etc other terminology
      - Cover a number of 'use cases': logging, broker,
        discovery/registry ...

    - Context Services
      - Skip

    - Infrastructure Services           
      - Ian's text is on infrastructure assumptions
      - Andrew produced a list but it needs review/discussion

(   - Discussion on the necessity of an "Abstract resource model"
          - For what purpose (universal vs used for 'mapping')
          - Do we do it vs define requirements and ask someone to do
            it for us
          - Jay to do a draft covering the following points
            - Need for model
            - GGF11 to GGF12 do requirements
            - Research on who is best to do it
            - Publicize by GGF12
            - Make decision at/post GGF12.
)

* Discussion on description pattern for capability chapter (Ch.4)

  - Proposal to use the data section outline for other sections
         Models
         Functional capabilities
         Properties
         Requirements on rest of OGSA

  - Models may not be applicable to other capabilities in the same way
  - Proposal to use 'PE' meta-diagram (Demand - Supply) as an
    organizational pattern (for other capabilities)
    - (Some concern whether it will create/raise more problems than it
      will solve and whether it can be applied to all other
      capabilities)
    - Decided to use it as meta-pattern

  - Agreed on a revised outline proposal (by DaveB)
    - Objectives
    - Models
      - Example scenarios
      - Supply/demand meta pattern
    - Functional capabilities
      - Interactions between capabilities
    - Properties
      - E.g. QoS
    - Interactions with the rest of OGSA

* Glossary

** Grid service

   - Do we have to avoid the term just because it stirred controversy
     in the past? 
     - No, if it is really meaningful (and is worth fighting for)
     - Yes, if it is just ends putting artificial barriers between
       grid and web services.

   - Is it possible to define its properties
     - Maybe (initially somewhat informally)
     - Andrew's list as one possible starting point
     - Some possible definitions (not normative) in Jem's
       summary. 
     - Tend towards "a Web service ... designed to operate
       ... and meet Grid requirements..."

   - For the glossary
     - Agreed to add that OGSI GS term is deprecated
     - And informal definition along the lines above.

* GGF11

  - Informational document for this submission
    - Put something together by Friday and update later
  - Put in new requirements chapter (revised if possible)
  - Put marketing diagram at a convenient place (head of chapter 4?)
  - Whether to put Ravi's cylinder & relationships diagram or not
    - Would like to extend to show 'ogsa strata' more 
    - (formatting (coloring) issue?)
    - Maybe add for this version (does it fit with what the text will be)
    - Action: Jeffrin to collect similar pictures and drive towards a
      common taxonomy (post ggf11) (Ravi, +) 
      > Send your taxonomies to Jeffrin.
  - New structure for Chapter 4 
  - Chapter 5 removed for this version (future definition)
  
* Document deadlines

  - Chapter 4 submissions
    - Most text to be available next week (early  to late)
    - By Topic:
      - Execution by Monday
      - Data by Monday
      - Self-management by late next week, or next next Monday
      - Resource management by monday
      - Information late next week

* GGF11 sessions

  - Reorganization of the existing sessions and adding one more session
    (self-*, information, context)

  Action: Hiro to send out the revised table.

  - Panel discussion: 
    - Not clear what we are after with this panel
    - DaveS: it is part of OGSA-WG's contribution/service to GGF
      (GFSG). Advertising of the flagship architecture.
    - Jay's idea: Call on an Analyst (e.g. IDC, Gartner) as moderator
      and three OGSA-WG members as panelists. After each panelist
      advocates his opinion (10 min each), moderator ask a couple of
      questions and panelist field them (about 30 min) then pick
      questions from the audience.
    - Jeffrin propose "Grid and Utility computing, same or different?"
      as its title.
    - Agreed to keep current title as is and refine expected content
      later.

* Identify architecture principles
  - Reviewed draft by Andrew
  - One slide from Jeffrin (separation of management concerns,
    multiple model support, etc)
  - Andrew to update draft and then decide where to add a section in
    the document "Design Principles"
    - Make sure only 'non-obvious' things are included
