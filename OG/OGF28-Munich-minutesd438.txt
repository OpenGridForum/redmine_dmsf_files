Network Measurement Working Group
Meeting March 16th, OGF28 Munich

The current NM-base document is almost finished. Martin needs to make a few corrections and will then Jason will put the document out for a last call.
Inder and Roman  have volunteered to do a thorough reviewing, but others are more than welcome to review the document as well.

The hierarchy of characteristics document has been sitting for a long time. The question is whether to leave it like that and do regular updates or to put it in the document track.
It was finally decided that the document will be reviewed thoroughly once more, and then a decision will be made.
Volunteers are Richard, Jeff, Martin, and Priscilla Moreyes.
