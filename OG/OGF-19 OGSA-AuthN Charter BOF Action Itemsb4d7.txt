OGSA-AuthN BoF document and contributer slide

Immediate actions needed for OGSA-WG
¥	develop basic, short-term use cases (AG)
¥	develop profile to support these use cases in the next 3-6 months (AG)
no scope creep allowed for these actions, so as not to stall HPCP

Proposed work or documents
¥	refine use of reusable tokens over secure channels in OGSA context
	(AS,BD;DS,NK)
	¥	possible and probably based on WS-I, profiling for
		identity needed for how to talk to a service, use cases
		needed, including username/password over TLS, PKI, Krb.
	¥	community practices document (AS): GFD.78, Unicore (DS),
		GRIA (??)
¥	interfacing SAML to Grid (GridShib, ShibGrid, SHEBANG,
	SLCS/SWITCH like) Ð
	(NK, MJ, CW, VonW, TomS) Ð relate to the GridShib BoF
¥	develop richer use cases to drive AuthN work (HK) -> working doc,
	no GFD track
	¥	should be based on general OGSA use cases

Postp[oned items
¥	AuthN roadmap (AS,NK Ð postponed till use case inventory complete)
	¥	including schedule when to complete specifications
¥	impersonation (postponed Ð 2-3yrs?)
	¥	PROTOCOLs to convey this information, for PKI, SAML,
		restricted rights &c
	¥	to create a SSO environment
	¥	or where man-in-the-middle is completely invisible
	¥	in federated idenity, the IdP is the entity; bearer credential
		influences LoA
	¥	active and/or ÔpassiveÕ authentication profiles
¥	conveyance of LoA in AuthN in protocols, (depends on LoA-RG output;
	need requirements first; -> postponed a bit)
	¥	LoA consumption by services, identification of entities; do
		we know the format?
