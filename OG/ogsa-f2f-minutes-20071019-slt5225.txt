Summary of Actions:  Group decided that we don’t understand the scope of the space enough to make any standard.  No action items.

Discussion of why we wanted a “computer-understandable” way of defining and understanding service level terms.  

Problem trying to solve:  Everyone submits everything by hand and users must go to websites to figure out the service level terms (manual)

Consensus - In the end, it was agreed that until we’re at a point that we can charge for services, then the industry doesn’t care.	

-Interesting research idea
-Too many research groups already
-Not a big enough issue for enough people to want to address
-Also, discussed the possibility of building off of WS-Agreement
