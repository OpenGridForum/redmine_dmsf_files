** EMS scenarios document **

* Andreas walks the group through the OGSA EMS Scenarios document.

* The group is discussing chapter 4.1 "Deploying an application".

* Ravi raises the issue whether it is always true that the client tooling
  always provides the JSDL document together with the corresponding CDL
  document, with respect to the assumption on the documents being consistent.
  - This raises the question on the exact definition of the term "consistence" 
    in this context.

* The group discusses "bullet 4" in chapter 4.1.
  - Ravi raises the issue whether the BES container, if it is a fron node of
    a cluster, should opaque the cluster aganst the JSDL and CDL document, or
    if that information on which particular host the BLAST application 
    will be installed (based on enquired information elsewhere) should/shall 
    be exposed to the JSDL and CDL documents
  - Ravi raises the issue on Deployment Services being capable of being 
    proxies to the final deployment host.
    * The issue is that if a DS acts as a proxy, the DS should not be forced 
      to advertise onto which hosts it is capable to deploy on.

PROPOSAL: To change "The DS MUST advertise (somewhere in a currently 
	  unspecified manner) ..." to "THe DS MAY advertise (somewhhere in a 
	  currently unspecified manner) ... "

* The group agrees to postpone this discussion on to a future OGSA-WG call.
