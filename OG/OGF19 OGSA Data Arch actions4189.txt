Actions for the Architecture document, from an informal meeting at OGF19.

[Mario] Drop the ChildSensitivity and ParentSensitivity from the data access
         section.
[Mario] Drop the parent resource property from the data access section.
[Mario] Mapping section - state that the stuff was derived from DAIS/ByteIO
         and possibly state why certain properties have not been used in the
         Data architecture. In general terms.
[Allen] Work on the storage chapter.
         Take into account feedback from OGF,
         re-write the whole thing + remove the file stuff that is out of place
         in our document.
[Allen] Work on the replication section. Write a couple of sentences on
         how to deal with the lifetime issue, for instance does deleting
         the master copy remove the replications.
[Mario] Describe the semantics of destruction of services/data in the
         early section. The service has to define it's semantics.
[Mario] Remove Destroy from the data access section - not addresseed in the
         remainder of the spec.
[Mario] DataResourceManagement is removed from the data access section and
         may get moved to the section that deals with the destruction of
         services. May throw this away.
[Mario] GetResourceList is removed from the data access section may be
         moved to a resource management section (along side the destruction
         operation).
[Mario] Remove most of the DAIS stuff from the appendix. Include a paragraph
         setting the context and scope of each of the specs.
[?]     The glossary needs to be updated.
[?]     Complete the appendices. Needs to be assigned.
[?]     The cache section needs to be completed.
[Dave?] Section 12 - Metadata Catalogue and Replication - needs to be worked
         on.
[Mario] Use the data access patterns to motivate the data access section.
[Mario] Create needs to be scoped down.
         Maybe break it down into separate operations.
