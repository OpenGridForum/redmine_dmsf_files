*** Add a new property "negotiation templates" as a RP to "Negotiation portType". Change the pictures accordingly. Re-check text for deployment scenarios. -> No impact on schema, only on WSDL.
*** Negotiation constraint importance
*** p.19 Add reference to GFD.107 to where Critical Extensions are defined. Check for other occurences.
*** p.25: Dominic's comment: Oliver is changing Figure 5 accordingly (adding Advertise(Offer) to the figure) and change text accordingly.
*** Action: p.26, Add template mechanism for NegotiationContext. Requires an additional picture.
