Proposal for a Life Sciences Grid Research Group Leadership Committee

We would like to propose that a sub-group be formed to carry on the leadership of the LSG-RG group.  This sub-group would meet regularly via conference phone (monthly, or to be determined), and would plan future meetings and workshops, discuss speakers to invite, oversee committee work, and carry on all other aspects of leadership of the group.  We feel that this committee is necessary to broaden the scope of the leadership, since the Life Sciences is such a broad range of specialities.

We would like to solicit volunteers to serve on this leadership committee.  Any such volunteers would have to make a committment to attending all the monthly conference calls and to actively participate and contribute to the work of said leadership committee.
